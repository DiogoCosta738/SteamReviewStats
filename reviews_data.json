        "text": "Hollow Knight is without a doubt one of the most polished metroidvanias out there.And, in line with my review of Blasphemous, I think it does a great job of updating the formula with souls-elements. In this particular, HK is much better, since it keeps the traditional ability-based progression of metroidvanias (unlike Blasphemous, whose upgrades are rather negligible and only for combat).I think it is a near-perfect marriage of the two genres (although I must admit I much prefer 3D navigation).The game is very smooth and fun to play. It is almost never punishing (ok, a couple of elements for the endings felt a bit off, but not too much, and perfectly reasonable as a climax). The exploration is really well done, for the most part, keeping you on a clear \"main path\" while nonetheless showing you all the nooks of crannies that either have a reward or show you a path to be accessed later. The combat and platforming are great. And it has quite a lot of content - it took me nearly 37 hours for 98%, which includes the \"harder\" ending (which was indeed difficult, but well worth the time!).And yet, there's one thing that keeps it from going into my favorite games' list: it does practically nothing \"new\" or \"surprising\". The abilities are just taken from your traditional castlevania game: double jump, ground/air dash, stomp, etc.; you have directional attacks and a couple of extra abilities (like a projectile, a whirlwind, and a big above-attack).These are all elements you've probably seen dozens of times if you're a fan of the genre. And I don't think they're used in any particularly original way.That's the core of my impression of the game. It's a really good metroidvania, modernized with souls elements. If you're a fan of either genre, or new and interested, absolutely give this a go, because it is an excellent game within the genre.If you're not, there's almost no reason for you to play it.I don't think it really \"adds to the conversation\" in any way, which is usually why I play games. So, in a way, it is disappointing.A couple of minor points:- The map has markers you can place, but these are far from insufficient; at some point I was trying to keep track of certain \"barriers\" so that I could go back to them later, but the number limit prevented me from using them effectively; the lack of \"notes\" is also unpleasant, especially since some places are just intriguing and not obviously about a certain ability.- The game has a \"build\" system using \"charms\": these are modifiers you can equip (for example, accelerating the time it takes to heal, giving you higher invincibility frames, making your attacks' faster or have longer reach, etc.), each one occupying X slots, of a total of Y. This creates an interesting balance, with powerful charms taking more slots, thus preventing you from taking others.Some charms also synergise with others, and so on.You can change the loadout at any \"bench\" (of bonfire, for those familiar with the souls games).I really like this way of doing things. It lets you adapt to different challenges very easily, and experimentation is fun. They do not fundamentally change the way you play, but are welcome tactical tweaks.- Backtracking can be a bit annoying. There are various \"vehicles\" connecting more distant parts of the map, but they are sometimes far apart and make the experience rather unpleasant. This applies mostly to the end of the game (there is one extra mechanic that helps, but not enough).- I loved the \"good ending\". Not the ending itself, but the extra hoops to reach it, and the boss itself. It was much, much harder than the other bosses, but it felt like a proper final boss - unlike the \"default\" final boss, which is a pushover. Here, slight spoilers the default final boss is the first phase of the real final boss, which has 2 extra phases with no checkpoint in between, but you are healed after the first phase; I would have preferred a more difficult default final boss that wasn't tied to the real one. Defeating the default boss becomes just a time punishment, the fight is very easy and only adds a time lag between attempts against the real final boss. It's not a huge issue, but a bit annoying. Plus, without this punishment, the actual final boss could have been made a bit more interesting/difficult. Punishment, in general, is not an interesting game design lever, imo..Just to put it in perspective, most bosses probably took me only one or two attempts. Some more difficult bosses took maybe up to 10 (30 minutes?). The real final boss took me maybe an hour or two (perhaps this was still around 15 attempts, but the fight much longer). All of this said, it felt great once I finally defeated it.- Spoiler alert (about mechanics, not story)! It's an important point for me, however. I somehow missed the weapon upgrade, initially, and suddenly found sections of the game really difficult, including a nearly impossible bossfight. All of that became trivial when I upgraded the weapon, for which I had ample resources. The weapon has multiple damage upgrades. This honestly made the game a lot less satisfying in one way: when I found a boss or area difficult, I no longer knew whether I should keep practicing or just go elsewhere until I had enough for another upgrade. I really dislike this kind of doubt introduced by permanent stats progression. I would have much preferred if the game had stable stats and navigate progression through abilities - which unlock more possibilities and not raw power. Basically, wherever is reachable should be \"balanced\". ",

        "text": "Scorn is an apt game given how the name makes me feel.It's the perfect example of someone convincingly telling a team of environmental artists \"Hey, let's make a Giger inspired game!\" and everyone going \"Yeah!\". And that's about as far as it goes.Off you go, crafting some genuinely stunning environments, full of Giger's bio-mechanical architecture and weirdly horrific sexual statues. Plus some gratuitous gore, deformed fleshy bodies, torture and lots of sphincter penetration.The game plays out entirely as \"there's this weird thing you see is interactable but can't interact with. Keep walking, find another weird thing you can interact with. Go back and interact with the thing. This opens a door with a long corridor with some more meaningless lever things. Repeat for 5 hours.\"; well, that, and absolutely atrocious combat, with needlessly slow and clunky walking, aiming and reloading. And don't get me going on the amount of time that the death animation takes and how the checkpoint is often before cutscenes.The game is padded beyond description - which is a huge feat for a 5 hour game.It's unfortunate that I am being so negative, but everything in the game was just a hurdle with no payoff. There's nothing interesting.The game is beautiful, it's great to walk around in. But that's about it. And, honestly, it's not even the kind of art that benefits from having a full 3D environment. You can get about as much awe from the screenshots as you get from playing the game - I would say games like Manifold Garden or Naissance are the opposite, spaces in which walking around feels different from static screenshots.The sound design is \"ok\", but nothing stellar or surprising.And even the artstyle is entirely derivative of Giger. So... maybe go and get HR Giger ARh+ from OpenLibrary?The gameplay is pure padding and the combat really terribly designed. Playing itself was seemingly unending frustration.With that in mind, if you think that's okay and the screenshots appeal to you, go ahead and get it.",

        "text": "I'm a huge fan of Year Walk and rhythm games, so, despite the unappealing \"aesthetic\", I had my eye on this game for a while. Unfortunately, while I am \"okay\" with the music (again, not my style, but I can appreciate what it's doing), the gameplay has deep design flaws that resulted in a frustrating experience.First, this isn't a rhythm game at all. It's a runner game as well as a \"concept album\", if you will. There are some sections that rely on pressing a button along the song's beat, but they are rare, a sprinkle, not at all the core of the game.Most of the game is about moving sideways, occasionally in 2D; not like Audiosurf by moving lanes, but \"freely\", and also not to the rhythm of the song.This was disappointing (just by expectation), but not what colored my opinion.The biggest problem is that the game struck a compromise between being a \"vibes\" game and a \"challenge\" game; but it didn't resolve the tensions between these, it just resigned itself to them, with the result that neither side ends up being very good.By a \"vibes game\", I mean one where you just sit back and enjoy the music and gameplay in a casual (in regards to gameplay) way. You don't worry about score, dying, etc.; by a \"challenge game\", I mean one where you're trying to optimize the score, or at least going for \"gold rank\" in each level, actively engaged in your performance.When it comes to \"vibes\", most of the levels are far too short - maybe a minute long?It feels like the level ends before you really get started. It's impossible to get into the \"flow state\" so common in rhythm games. You start getting into it, the song ends, you go back to the menu, the music stops, and so on (yes, you unlock an arcade mode after the first playthrough, which skips the menu part, but still).When it comes to \"challenge\", the problem is the opposite. Getting a gold rank (and I won't even attempt the \"wild\" rank which is hidden and requires near perfect play) can be very frustrating, since you need to play without dying, and in some levels must pick \"the one correct path\" that has enough valuable score-collectables. Though most levels are short, some are long, making it very easy to die and frustrating to start over. You are also unable to evaluate the point in each path (either because it's literally impossible to see, or because the camera is moving so fast that you don't have time to react), meaning it relies on memorization - and a kind of memorization that has nothing to do with the music, but simply with game logic (go left/right, how to avoid the obstacle you know is coming, etc.).There is also not a button to instantly restart a level or skip cutscenes, which means you often have to (1) open menu (2) pick restart (3) open menu again (4) pick skip cutscene; whenever you want to restart a level. The game is also not at all transparent about score. There are different things you can pick up, some of which increase a multiplier, some which don't. Dying resets the multiplier. But the game doesn't even show you there is a multiplier - probably because it wants to focus on vibes rather than challenge.The level design can also be terrible. The perspective and camera angle constantly changes, making it very difficult to judge which way the character is heading and whether you need to move to dodge an obstacle or not. Some sections are very fast, which branching paths that make a real difference in the final score, forcing you to pick them at random and memorize which one is better so that you pick it on the \"final\" run.Mechanically, it's okay, but very gimmicky. Sometimes you drive a motorcycle, something you fly, sometimes you drive a car that drifts, sometimes you play a topdown shooter-like game, sometimes you play an on-rails shooter.It keeps things varied, for sure, but also very very shallow. It doesn't really build up or explore any set of mechanics. It's more like an amusement park, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.Sooooo yea. I did not enjoy this at all. Lots of people seem to hold the game close to their hearts, so don't take my word for it!The music, while not my style, had some moments I liked. The visual style is very unique and quite cool. Certainly fits the music.There is a story which, while very indirectly told, is there for people who care about it, with mildly interesting symbolism.I like what it's attempting to do, for sure, but the gameplay simply does not work, in my experience.I've played it once \"for the vibes\", and was annoying at the fragmented state of the songs, at the lack of flow from one track to the next.Then I've replayed all levels (currently, except the very last one) to get the gold rank, and found all the frustrating aspects regarding the chaotic and unpredictable paths, perspectives, scoring mechanisms, and so on.Either the devs should have spent more time trying to resolve the tensions between the two modes, or they should have committed to one and make it excellent. I'll probably try the arcade mode later on, but I'll be away from a computer for a few days, so who knows.I'd recommend \"A Musical Story\" for those interesting in a narrative focused rhythm/music game (it is an actual rhythm game, and actually very difficult and frustrating if you try to \"perfect\" the levels, but one that is also rewarding and perfectly works as a \"vibes game\" if you don't care about score; and it manages to create a perfect musical flow even in the midst of short tracks and \"player failure\").Update: I've tried Arcade mode. It's marginally better, but the songs still don't really seamlessly flow into one another - you get an outro and intro, with the songs fading to/from silence and a portal animation. I've also gotten gold rank in the last level. For these, just follow Bryan Johnson's advice.Neither changes what I wrote above.",

        "text": "An excellent and amazing audio-visual space, channelling Escher and Piranesi, but with its own character!The same cannot be said for the actual puzzles, imo.First, I really love the artstyle - from all the gravity bending architecture (with all the ensuing illusive feeling), to the chinese-like window ornaments, to the subtle but surgically applied distortion effects, to the rendering style and coloring. It's extremely unique and very well made.The sound and music didn't stand out as much, but the music was impactful when there, and the sound put to great use in service of gravity.One big problem, for me, is that most of the game's mechanics are largely independent from the whole idea of \"connected/repeating space\" that the game relies on for the visuals. The mechanics are mostly about 2 concepts: (1) you can pick the direction of gravity (one of the 6 directions in 3D) and (2) you move blocks around, but can only move blocks whose color matches the gravity direction.There are variations to this, but nothing fundamental, nothing really surprising.While some puzzles use the infinitely repeating space as a mechanic (mostly to move around, say, going up by falling), that's not the core of the game, and the game never uses these ideas to surprise the players (or have the players surprise themselves).The second big problem, and it may be much worse, is that the game is not so much about solving a clear puzzle. It's not the likes of SpaceChem or Sudoku or Sokobond where the whole puzzle is in front of you, you know the rules, and you work out the solution (sometimes even with the game closed).Instead, the game tends to have sprawling levels with contorted architecture, with the relevant pieces lying around in the corners. It's very difficult to actually visualize the space, it's easy to miss pieces or \"levers\" you can interact with. The result is that you spend a lot of the time just moving around more or less at random looking for a yellow cube; or maybe you have a yellow cube, but need to look for the place where it can be used, God knows where.One of the mechanics involves giant pieces (tetris like) that are affected by gravity. But the space is so large that you can't really see where the block is moving - and the objective is to move them all, in specific order, into a final configuration, without having them getting stuck in each other. It's like half-blind Sokoban.These were just not satisfying at all. Often either dull or annoying.Which is unfortunate, because the game has one truly excellent face.I'd still recommend it, because there's something here that no other game has done (or at least not as well). It's certainly worth it just as a space to walk around in and marvel at.But I cannot vouch for the puzzles. They weren't terrible, despite the problems I mentioned above, but they're not great, either. Unlike The Witness, I didn't get any plan or purpose guiding the puzzles. They felt like a few disparate ideas for mechanics thrown together. And they weren't very difficult, if you ignore the visibility factor. Something like The Talos Principle is far more difficult, despite having much smaller puzzles that you can hold in your head. All of these are, in my opinion, much better \"puzzle\" games.This one is a \"decent-at-best\" puzzle game with a stellar aesthetic.  ",

        "text": "It's good. Neither revolutionary nor excellent, but better than I expected!Having played Bloodstained recently, I couldn't help but think (again) that the souls formula supercedes the castlevania one - it hits many of the same spots, but better.So I was curious to try Blasphemous and see how it would fare.The bosses and enemies required a lot more careful and deliberate play, which is fantastic. It's exactly where I thought Bloodstained was weakest. The GBA Castlevanias were quite good in this regard: rooms were quite narrow, so you really had to learn enemy patterns. Bloodstained was mostly about spamming, or \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 enemies that ran into walls, becoming invulnerable while shooting at you from out of reach. Blasphemous requires you to learn the patterns, but it never \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 (with one DLC exception).I feel like the difficulty could be a bit higher, for most boss fights. Most bosses I killed on first or second attempt. The vast majority took me less than 15 minutes. Maybe one took me 40-60 minutes. So there is a bit of room, but I don't mind it being on the easier side. It was almost always a fair challenge.One disappointment is how the game is quite... unimaginative (?), mechanically. I find Salt & Sanctuary a better game for this reason. You simply lack weapon variety (single weapon), ability variety (no double jumping, wall jumping, or any other game changing abilities), and so on. There are some cryptic items that provide a marginal benefit, but they feel very very light.All the back tracking and shortcut unlocking is designed around doors, elevators and levers. Certainly part of Souls, but disappointing.What was very positively surprising, however, was the artstyle and lore. I had no idea about the Andalucian/Southern Spanish influence, here. The game has a very strange christian outlook, created around real stories and figures (the jewelled saints, a lady who burned herself to keep her chastity, etc.) and christian values like guilt. And the architecture mixes the expected Gothic with the surprising Alhambra/Moorish influence.This aspect is great and extremely unique.Finally, I will say that the \"quests\" and challenges were rather dull and disappointing. Also very cryptic.You can place markers on the map, but not label them or make notes. One quest requires you to traverse back and forth without using teleporting, searching for 3 enemies, which is extremely annoying and entirely pointless. There are a group of \"gauntlet\" challenges which were trivially easy and so entirely pointless.In general, it's too cryptic and if you miss the dialogue the first time, you have no way to regain the information.Overall, I found this a very solid game. Again, not amazing, as it was a bit on the bland side, mechanically, and the tuning doesn't quite reach excellence. But definitely worth playing. ",

        "text": "Looks great, but I see little reason for this to exist.I haven't read the novel, but, having played the game, I see no reason whatsoever for it being made into a game. There's nothing interesting , either mechanically or following from player agency.From wikipedia: \"The team chose to adapt this novel because they felt that the book is \"stunningly picturesque\" and that it \"reads as a ready-made movie script\".\"Well, maybe they should have made a movie, instead of a game?It's not terrible. It's a beautiful walking simulator with an interesting story and big pacing issues.The game has several sections of slow walking with no dialogue or anything else happening. It also has several sections where you can't move or act, waiting for dialogue to finish.Dialogue should be there to break up the monotony of slow walking.The general feeling I got from the story is surprisingly similar to Solaris, another of Lem's novel - a sort of gothic novel about an encounter with a strange and incomprehensible \"intelligence\".There were some themes I liked, but a lot of what the characters said made no sense, to me, especially when it was about biology or philosophy. I suspect this is more on the developer's part than the author's, but I can't say for sure.Again, it's not terrible. But I see no reason for it to be a game at all. If anything, the interesting aspects seem to derive directly from the novel, so... maybe read that instead?Unless you want to walk around in an admittedly beautiful wasteland of a planet, which you may, and in which case there is definitely something for you here.Kudos, also, for attempting a fairly serious take on \"classical sci-fi\".",

        "text": "I love the game's style. The art is top notch. The music... was disappointing. Some sounds appropriately medieval, but it often slips into vague fantasy music. It was a missed opportunity - why not use \"authentic\" music to match the visuals? Hildegard is a character in the game!I like the game's mechanics. From a tactics standpoint, the game is enjoyable. Positioning, environmental hazards, buffs/debuffs, all play a central role and it is satisfying to play.The problem in on the \"strategy\" side, and the decision to add perma-death, to make it a \"rogue-lite\".Despite having many different \"races\", the units themselves come from a small template of \"classes\", cutting the variation by quite a lot. From my (admittedly short) experience, the various races didn't really interact or synergize much with each other. There was simply too little experimentation to make the repetition worthwhile.The concept of \"generosity\" somehow seemed useful to apply to rogue-lites, in terms of how much they offer in different runs. A game like The Binding of Isaac, for example, is very generous. There are so many different items you can get, often interacting in countless ways with one another - you're not playing to beat the game, you're playing to experience the combinatorial explosion in all its splendour.Inkulinati is the exact opposite. There isn't much in the way of exploration or combinations of items, skills, units, etc.; the player's goal is simply to beat the game. Perma-death is pure punishment, it only gets in the way. A further point is about how battles are designed - they are often gimmicky. By which I mean - they rely on some combination of units and level configurations that require certain approaches to beat. And you pick your loadout before-hand. What often ends up happening is that you picked the completely wrong loadout for a challenge you could not have foreseen. And you lose. Back to the beginning. The second time around, however, you know what to expect. The fight becomes easy, if not trivial.This, to me, is exactly the wrong way to design a game with perma-death. It is not fair, and it isn't building general skills used throughout the game - instead, it's mostly about recognizing the type of gimmick that the level is throwing at you.Sooooo yeah. I played a full run on Hard mode, but I manually backed up the save files to avoid having to deal with perma-death. Some battles were very easy, let's call them \"filler\". Some I lost the first time and easily beat the second time. I think only one took 3 attempts (and it was not a bossfight). I think this kind of profile exemplifies what I mean. Repetition, to me, is welcome to help you build up your skill up to the point where you can face later and harder areas of the game. To use another of Edmund Mcmillen's games as an example - in Super Meat Boy, I often went back and played earlier levels, in a kind of speedrun, when I got stuck in the later ones. It helped me build up dexterity and better mechanic intuition, which would pay off in later levels - in a way that just banging my head against the later levels wouldn't have been much more helpful. Repetition had a role, there.In here, you have all the skill you need to beat any particular level - but you may pick the wrong loadout the first time, get screwed over, and thus forced to repeat the whole sequence from the beginning. Because of a gimmick, not inherent level of challenge.So, ultimately, I don't really recommend the game. It isn't terrible. Again. the art style and theme are great. The tactical side of the mechanics works well (although it isn't particularly ground breaking or anything).But making it a rogue-lite was a terrible decision, and feels like a waste of players' time. Either way, I don't really feel like playing it any more. Doing one solid run was cool. I could imagine doing a few more, but the game didn't really capture my interest enough when there are so many others out there.",

        "text": "It's okay.When the game came out, I thought the 3D graphics were a significant downgrade from the 2D versions (both SotN and the GBA ones), but it actually looks alright, and the cartoonish characters look much smoother than I expected.The music is great, but not nearly as memorable as the NES versions.As a castlevania game, it's quite competent. I don't think it will blow anyone's mind, but I think it provides the right kind of experience (again, in line with SotN and the GBA games, not the \"classic\" arcade games). Including all the campiness in dialogue and character design as well as the \"imbalance\" in weapons and equipment.That said, I think it's a genre that really didn't age well. Specifically, it is made almost redundant by the advances from the \"souls-like\" games, which in my opinion are simply a better implementation of the traditional metroidvania characteristics: map exploration, enemy pattern learning and build crafting.So a \"true to form\" castlevania game just feels rather stale.One thing I really dislike is how the game forces you to play on normal mode the first time around - unless you somehow look online to learn that you can rename your profile to unlock difficulties. I was already several hours in and didn't feel like replaying those, so I feel a bit screwed over, tbh.The first half of the game felt extremely easy, to me. Most bosses didn't require you to learn any patterns at all, spamming attacks and tanking would get you through.Then there was a big spike in difficult (with one particular boss whose patterns I actually had to learn and was great). After that, the game became quite a lot harder, but still spotty - some areas still felt very easy, while others frustrating, though mostly due to the lack of a save room.The game has a quite complicated food crafting system that felt hugely cumbersome and entirely pointless.The equipment crafting and improvement also, to an extent. It is reliant on grinding, and only really serves a purpose on higher difficulties, I would imagine.Overall, I really feel like normal difficulty is not well designed, since maybe 70% of the bosses don't require you to learn patterns or pick the right equipment, or whatever. It really makes a majority of the mechanics pointless, which I don't think should ever be the default (let alone forced) difficulty.Another point worth mentioning is that the game does a really poor job of communicating how certain items and skills open up paths. Somethings it's a skill shard from a boss (obvious and expected for the genre), but sometimes is a piece of equipment in a random chest whose *text description* tells you its special ability - among 20 other junk pieces of equipment that you have no reason to read. Sometimes, in a similar way, it's a drop from a random mob, which once again is completely out of step with the other random mob drops.Regarding the souls comparison: the exploration, especially of new areas, is much more frustrating when you lose progress completely when you die - back to the previous save room. I much prefer the \"keep the exploration and items, but lose XP\".Teleport rooms are separate from save rooms - which is just a waste of time.Crafting is in a separate part of the map, which forces you to find a teleport room, to go back to the entrance of the castle, and then back to where you where. Using bonfires as a crafting hub and save point is much more elegant.Health potions are quite expensive, and you're limited to 5. Once again, using flasks is much more elegant, especially since upgrading them can be part of the general progression, or your specific build's. Better choices.In conclusion, I think the game is a competent Castlevania of the metroidvania era. I think I prefer the GBA games (they were stricter about learning enemy patterns), but this isn't bad at all.Forcing the (unaware) player to go through normal difficult was an idiotic decision - one that really made the game less enjoyable for me. With so many games to play (and not that much time), a game has to be really really good for me to spend 10-15 hours replaying the same content - especially if the first pass was rather mediocre.And I think the genre is almost redundant after souls-likes. I much preferred Salt and Sanctuary, for example. They are games designed around the same general concepts, but the latter a more effective version.Still, if you're a fan of Castlevania, this is a good one, despite many design flaws (which were also a hallmark of previous games, so you can't really complain).

        "text": "Cool, but not quite what I was looking for.In a nutshell:- great aesthetic (the music very cool, unexpectedly, because not my style)- very open island island to explore- thick plot which completely unravels at the end- unique charactersThere were some things that ultimately failed, in my view:(1) the openness of the island is cool, but it is filled to the brim with meaningless collectables, only a small portion of which are relevant to the story; I actually spend the first five hours of the game doing nothing but following these shiny breadcrumbs before engaging with the story line and characters. The first two hours were satisfying, by the fifth it got extremely dull. Evidence-wise, the game devolves into finding many needles in a haystack. Eventually, you get an \"upgrade\" which makes it easy by showing an icon overlaid on the screen of their positions. This also feels like a cop-out. But, anyway, it's not really guided by evidence, it's all \"just there\" from the beginning, spread all over the place. Unsatisfying.(2) none of the deduction and putting the facts together happens in your head, the player's. It's all just in the screen. You don't need to think, you just need to collect everything, pick every dialogue option, and the case will solve itself.This, in my opinion, is the game's biggest failure - because I am explicitly looking for games that do it differently. Still, the game has a lot of character and, despite some unsatisfying choices, I enjoyed it. Not as good as I had hoped, but still worth playing, if it seems up your alley.",

        "text": "Big disappointment, but I'll give the game a positive recommendation for at least trying to do something different.The first impression you get is from the game's low production values. The writing is rather simple and stereotypical, the music couldn't be more generic, and while I like the game's backgrounds, the characters look like the most hyperbolic anime characters imaginable, with scars everywhere, huge muscles, and oversized gilded armor. It just doesn't really fit (anywhere). But this is fine.The biggest problem, however, is how formulaic the game is. The premise is you're a detective, investigation a murder. Which sounds really cool, and to me suggests a very good alternative for a deep RPG, mechanically, that doesn't rely on just bashing everything in your path.But... Everything is so abstracted as to lose all meaning.My fondness for CRPGs comes from the attempt at making more realistic and subtle writing, to an extent. There a are crafted worlds, with real characters and ideas behind something like Fallout and Planescape Torment. There's none of that here, because the game, ultimately, is a glorified \"Who's who\".There are maybe 10 suspects. 7 of them had a motivation for the murder. Half of them had a wounded arm (a clue for the fight during the murder). All of them will lie to you about where they were on the night of the murder, only to give you to opportunity to either confront them with a clue you've received from another character, or a card mini-game of \"tactical diplomacy\".The actual motive doesn't matter at all. All that matters is that you've found \"a\" motive. You don't need to get to know the *character* and to deduce that they may have been the murderer.The game is built around exhaustively going through all the \"checkboxes\" (do fetch quests for each character to befriend them, then confront them to gather a clue). At some point, you'll have enough info to determine the murderer through a series of abstract clues (murderer is man/woman, strong/weak, religious/non-religious, and so on). Ultimately, this abstraction is necessary to make the game a \"procedurally generated RPG\". Unfortunately, it is also enough to make it an uninteresting one. It prevents you from crafting a real story with all the nuance that great stories have.I will not write much else.The game has a turn-based, deck-building combat system. It's competent enough. It also has a \"diplomacy\" card mini-game which is also quite okay.The stats and skills are a bit disappointing (in the sense that they do not lead to many choices during the playthrough; especially not informed ones, I picked most of the skills early on without knowing where they would be useful, and they seemed to play only a minor role).The loop is quite compelling. You have a limited amount of places you can visit per day, restricting the characters you can talk to or the (fetch) quests you can attempt. Plus a satisfying amount of combat and resource management (mostly money).Aside from the cheap look and feel, the game is definitely enjoyable. It doesn't do anything amazing, but again, it is competent. I enjoyed my time with it.But the main draw of the game (for me), the \"detective CRPG\" is just not interesting in the least. And the writing, such an important aspect of a CRPG, also leaves a lot to be desired.I hoped the game would \"add something to the conversation\". Open some doors for CRPG developers to venture further into. But it seems to have been a dead end. Very little worth exploring in this specific direction.Still, it is trying something new, and the core gameplay is enjoyable, so I'll leave this as a \"positive\" review.",

It's playful, but it takes its themes seriously. There is a kind of innocence and naivet\u00e9, too, which is a great antidote for the cynicism in the air.It's a game that cares little about other games. It is very much its own thing, and should be enjoyed as such.I'll say that where it tries to be more of a \"game\" (in comparison with Jack's previous games, especially), it feels very underwhelming, to me. The puzzles are often too easy, becoming filler, you're just going through the motions. You collect hundreds of coins which you cannot use because you've already bought everything 60% of the way through. And so on. (the bosses are quite okay, though)But that's not why Judero exists, and that's not why you should play it. In the game's own words, \"The highest form of love is always something with a grain of salt\".If nothing else, please play the demo. If you \"get it\", no more words are needed. ",

        "text": "First impressions were extremely good. The music was cool, varied and wholesome, and the game had a weird aesthetic hearkening me back to the PS1 era with games like Rescue Shot.The rhythm mechanics aren't very innovative, but they work and are satisfying.Unfortunately, these impressions didn't last, and the game ultimately felt unsatisfying. I'll keep it short and to the point:(1) both the music and characters, while \"good\", failed to take off and leave a memorable mark. Think about \"Born to be Bone\" or \"Tainted Lovers\" - there's nothing here that even comes close. The game and levels have dynamics, for sure, with some djenty metal for the intense parts - but most of it ends up being generic electronic pop with only a few sonic spice here and there. (2) the game gives you no tools whatsoever to deal with difficulty. This only became a real issue in the \"prequel\" aspect of the game (post main story) and the challenge levels, but it applies broadly. The fast sections are almost impossible to read as you play, and yet the game gives you no real way to practice. \"Easy mode\" isn't any slower, it simply removes the distinction between the left and right buttons. This won't help much if you just need to practice, since half of the challenge is figuring out which hand should play which note, not the rhythm itself. Similarly, hard mode is just \"faster\", or \"hands flipped\", which is exactly the wrong approach? More complex patterns would be the way to go, in my opinion.Plus, there isn't any build up to the difficult sections. You don't get an easier version of the pattern to get used to. No, instead, the song completely changes with no period of habituation, leaving you scrambling to figure out what you're even supposed to play.It's mostly a problem of readability and preparation than actual execution.(3) Replayability - each level has a score and combo targets, awarding you a special CD which unlocks skins and weapons if you get both. But the score is so unforgiving as to not be fun at all. Missing no notes but playing several of them \"imperfectly\" (which has a small window) forces you to repeat the level to get the CD. I tried this for the first few levels and it was no fun at all. It simply gives you a very small tolerance for the perfect notes, and it's not even clear, as you play, how many you have \"missed\".In sum, the game is okay, maybe good, but not great at all. It was a big disappointment to me when I realized I had no desire whatsoever to keep playing after I beat the main story (and the prequel up to the final boss).The game is cute and can be fun for the main story. But when it ramps up the difficulty, it is a stone wall which doesn't suggest any path forward.The game gives you no way to learn, really. And the extra goals are too strict. Ultimately, it feels like the game doesn't want you to reach for those. So I won't.Almost great, but several missteps in the design prevent it from becoming a reference rhythm game, for me.",

The contrivance of being unable to access videos by date wasn't ever really explained (and can actually be circumvented, within the game's rules, in a really simple way, if you're willing to \"cheat\").There is no way to make notes in-game, you can't pause videos, the tags sometimes seem not to work, there aren't really any discrete mysteries or clue to track and solve - for example, (very mild spoiler) there was a point in the game where you learn about some knock codes, like morse, and two of the videos contain such a code. Naturally, I decoded it, only to be disappointed with inconsequential flavor text. This would have been a great example of revealing something to the player which suddenly uncovered a lot more information to pursue, but no.So, ultimately, mechanically, all the game is is a collection of videos which you search for by the spoken words. The words in one video suggest other videos, and so on. You find the videos out of order and so it takes a bit to put the story together in your head.Again, it's a really cool idea, and the narrative parts really works! But it's very bare bones and there is no mechanical build up or anything, which is disappointing.Still definitely worth a play, if it seems like something you could enjoy, if only for the novelty.Also - I didn't really care for the specifics of the story. Nothing here spoke to me, but I'm not a fan of crime mysteries, so hey.",

        "text": "It's cute, and I the last song was very funny (I certainly did not expect a rockin' police chase and throng of headbanging seagulls!), but it's not a very good rhythm game, mainly for two reasons:(1) the controls are terrible; setting up the button vertically(up, mid, down) on the screen but the controller layout horizontally (LB, X, RB) is extremely unintuitive, which is a big problem for a 15 minute game, which doesn't let you build up any intuition at all; you can rebind the controls, but to a single key, which is the wrong way to do it in rhythm games, imo; mirroring the dpad with the xyab buttons is the way to go.(2) the animations in the background are cool, but you cannot really pay attention to them at all when you're looking at the notes that are coming. This is a problem that games like Gitaroo Man have solved - have sections without gameplay, where you can play up the song narrative, and do just background effects while there is actual gameplay on the screen.If Mirth Island is not a rhythm game at all, then this feedback may be irrelevant - but the demo was literally *just* the rhythm game (picking up 5 items to get one or two dialogue lines for it doesn't count).It's not terrible, and it lasts maybe 15 minutes, so :shrug:.

The main game is very very short, but you're encouraged to keep playing to basically get collectibles (freeing the animals and encyclopedia pages), or go for daily runs. While I would generally consider this to be a rather cheap way out, I think it works really well, here - the reason being that, gameplay-wise, this is a very slow-burner. It's about spending some relaxing time and building up the intuition of when to grab a branch, when to let you, and so on.It's not a game that you really play with a set goal, but rather something you casually zone out to, go with the flow.It's rather situational, but I think it works.Finally, the story was quite well told, despite its simplicity, and it has a good message.Overall, I love how unique it is.

        "text": "Jack King-Spooner's games are really a breath of fresh air, to me. They remind of why I am into small in games in the first game.These game are very personal and honest, but they are also very weird, and... inconsistent, in a way? With most games, you more or less know what you're getting. They fit in a box, for better or for worse. They can be great and there is no issue with conforming to a genre or a mood and trying to be creative within it.But this is very different. You seem to have a snapshot of humanity in its many facets. Some things I found deeply touching (the bird scene, the dude trying to preserve his glee for life, ...) and resonating, others not at all. This is the risk of being so personal, but also its greatest strength. If you accept that not every scene needs to speak to you, you can get a lot out of this.A lot of the game is about death, but also just about life. You meet kind persons, you meet inconsiderate and selfish persons, and you meet strange, suffering persons. Most speak in aphorisms, condensing a personality - or a fragment of one -  into short sentences.It makes it very difficult to write about the game in the abstract. To me, it's really about the specific characters and situations more than anything. And I love it for it.It's empty, mechanically. You just walk around and talk to people.I tend to prefer games with choice - it's the thing that I find games can do that most other artforms can't. The bird scene, in particular, seemed very appropriate for such a choice.That's not what Beeswing is and again, that's fine. It does other things, none very bombastic.There are several technical issues - trying to advance the dialogue too quickly with break the game, and once I had to restart from scratch because a dialogue didn't close - a broken state which was stored in the savegame; so trying to reload only broke it permanently. I also got a broken section where trying to exit a scene would immediately loop me back - this one fortunately solved by reloading.So take it with caution.It's most definitely not a game for everyone, all of the time. But if you are in the right mindset, it can be very touching and inspiring - at least it was to me.With all the caveats, I very very strongly recommend this. This kind of game makes games worth playing, to me.",

        "text": "One of the best games I've played lately, and a big surprise.In short, this is a very different take on a rhythm game, with great emphasis (and success!) on narrative. It's like a playable concept album, with very tasteful layering of tracks, and the music perfectly fits and changes with the mood of the scenes.It also presents a uniquely challenging use of rhythm - not as a deviously fast sequence of inputs, but as an interplay of different rhythms and long silences that requires you to figure out the underlying rhythms and keep them all going in your head.I give it a whole-hearted recommendation for doing something different and good. It is also a fertile template for more rhythms games and can be taken in slightly different directions.That said, the game has some problems. They are not serious for a casual player who only wants to get through the game once, with mistakes. These problems become a lot more serious if you want to unlock the \"real ending\", which requires you to play every song perfectly - here, the game's flaws start to show, and the high difficulty can make for a frustrating experience. That said, I also found it rewarding, and is where the meaningful gameplay is to be found.General mechanicsThe game works as a \"call and response\" loop: you hear the short section being played, along with the on-screen cues, and then it repeats as you play it yourself. This is simple but effective. In early levels, you get an extra repetition (sound only, no visual cues), to get you into the groove.The patterns aren't very fast. This is not a japanese style rhythm game, or Through the Fire and the Flames in Guitar Hero!If you miss one of the inputs, the same track keeps looping, until you get them all.There is initially no visual indicator of where the track is (aside from the success/failure of the notes), but one will appear, intermittently, the more times you fail the sequence (and you can permanently enable/disable it in the options).This is one of the game's biggest faults, honestly, which I'll address later.Each level is a series of these loops, usually relying on the same underlying pulse, but playing different patterns and iterations. In the harder later levels, these are very different from each other (sometimes too different), which can make it quite difficult to get through the level in a single go (because it becomes a lot harder to memorize and prepare in advance for what is to come).The game is also not very precise with its input - in fact, some of the faster levels have a huge tolerance, so that your sense of rhythm can be very off and still \"succeed\". This, in a way, alleviates the need for input delay control and so on, but it also means the game is not as snappy as most other rhythm games (for example, there is no distinction between normal, good and perfect hits, which is something that typically makes rhythm games a lot more satisfying!).DifficultyFor a normal playthrough, in which you aren't trying to perfect a level, all of this is fine. If you miss a note, the track will just play again, but each one lasts for 2 bars, a few seconds, no big loss.The problem is very different when you're trying to perfect levels, because, in the second half, they can take longer than 5 minutes - and a single mistake requires you to restart the whole level.This is compounded by the nature of the difficulty - (1) poly-rhythms, (2) unclear pulses and (3) long notes. By which I mean, (1) you are hearing one rhythm in the background and playing another (sometimes playing both for different instruments), or (2) perhaps it isn't even clear what the underlying rhythm should be, because the track is silent, or sparse, or (3) there are long periods of silence between notes, and they start in some weird off beat that is difficult to keep track of.I have two things to add about this: It's actually great that the game uses real musical ideas as the source of difficulty, rather than very fast cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s of inputs; and these rhythmic variations are great musical spice, it's some of what makes music interesting!And it made for much more interesting gameplay, and I needed to consciously try to figure out what the rhythms at play actually were, or find cues in the backing track to help me now when the next note would come in. It made each level almost a puzzle. The real problem, however, is that most of the rhythms were kind of weird, and there was no breathing room, no way for the game to teach you any of the concepts that it demands you to understand or feel. This is very unfortunate. I love when games are challenging in this way, but this comes with the requirement that they also give you the tools to facilitate overcoming and challenge, and not just throwing you into the wolves and rely on pre-existing knowledge/skill to succeed.So yeah. Perfecting every level was sometimes a very frustrating experience. When every rhythm is slightly weird, paired with long levels (5+ min) and very different sections from one another, it becomes very easy to make a small mistake, requiring a full restart. Several levels took me close to 1 hour to perfect.Maybe I suck, but the game could have done a better job at this. Even allowing some margin of error by letting you \"recover\" from a miss by a streak of good notes, for example (of course, better input would be required).FeedbackThe other big problem I have with the game, and one that could have helped with difficulty, is the lack of feedback.I like the idea of not showing you where in the measure you are. That makes things very easy, and stops being about the music - it becomes about following a little dot on the screen and pressing the button when it reaches a note. The current implementation forces you to listen, feel and remember the music. It's a very good attempt!But there are problems: when dealing with complex poly-rhythms, coupled with long silences, it becomes quite difficult to keep track of everything - and I can only imagine this is much worse for casual players, unused to prog-rock/metal or jazz.the fact that your input isn't tied to the music in any way. There is some very low sound effect, but it never really comes into play. So, basically, it's like you're playing an instrument without hearing what you're playing - you're hearing only the playback. It makes it easy to lose track, thinking you're playing on time when you're not.Given that merely tracking a dot on the screen is a terrible solution, what could be done?Well, one idea, for me, would be to add some pulsing visuals in the background, playing the underlying rhythms. Players aren't supposed to be fully fledged musicians keep track of the multiple rhythms!Another would be to divide the circle on the screen into measures, to act as a better guide to the player, a visual pulse.These could be customized in the options, of course.And, of course, I'd strive for better input detection (dealing with all the annoyances of input delay, etc. that other rhythm games already deal with). This would allow you to give better feedback on perfect vs. good notes, for example (particles, sound, whatever), and also to slightly modified the background music to play the notes when you hit the buttons, rather than as mere playback. Mostly because then the player can actually hear when they are offbeat and self-correct.This idea of self-correction (or lack there of) is one of my biggest disappointments with the game. It's not a killer, but it's a weird miss for a game that takes musicality so seriously.ConclusionIt's been a while since I bothered to write a long and more or less organized review like this. I hope this is taken as a token of love!A Musical Story is a very unique approach to rhythm games, and it deserves a lot more attention than it got.",

There are no interesting choices, no interesting experimentation. This was actually a big miss-step, in my view: the loddles, the little critters, could have been a great mechanic, if you could guide their evolution in the direction of surviving and even *thriving* or healing each different environment. But no, the evolutions are almost purely cosmetic, and you need to do the busywork of cleaning up the habitat before they move in. They are simply not part of the game, mechanically - I went through the whole game without interacting with the loddles at all, simply because I had no reason to. (I see this equally as my own failure as the game's; my own lack of curiosity, paired with the game's failure to encourage experimentation with its mechanics)Finally, I find the environmental theme completely backward. It's a wishy-washy setup where you were hired to clean up the ocean after some big bad company exploited and abandoned the planet.But, of course, it ignores all the details of who's doing the hiring, and how difficult it would be to solve any of these environmental problems (no, you don't just vaccuum up microplastics).It's uses environmentalism as a token of tribal belonging, without an inkling of critical thinking. This is not the way.Yeah, it's cute. The visual effects are really great, and it's a pleasant experience - if you want to numb your mind for a few hours. We should demand a bit more for our time.",

Just don't expect a very polished or well designed \"game\". Some assorted notes:There are no random encounters, which I love. Unfortunately, it's not as if the encounters were well planned and varied. They seem as if they were procedurally generated, honestly, with a random assortment of enemies that feels all the same. There isn't a single encounter that sticks in my mind like \"oh, that required an interesting change of tactics\". Nah, you just learn how to deal with the more annoying enemies first (like the healer, or the stunner). But it's the enemy that is \"interesting\", and not the \"encounter\". Which is unfortunate. There was a lot of room to make something better, here.The idea of using the \"afterlife\" when you die (basically a hub world) is nice, especially since you can kind of improve your character by returning \"meat\" and getting health from the enemies you've killed before; but this is not worth the time purposelessly wasted just to get back to the place where you died. A reload is far more efficient.This is especially the case because of the game's difficulty - the game is inconsistently difficult.What I mean by inconsistently difficult is that many encounters could be near-impossible, if only the enemies didn't pick random attacks. This means that, sometimes, the enemies will happen to pick the right combination from the start and basically wipe the floor with you. And other times they don't and the encounter is doable. But this also means that you don't just have to \"play well\", you also need to be lucky. And this kind of repetition and randomness is terrible in combination with the interruption from death.I also found very little room for manoeuvring and experimenting with the combat. The consumable items are largely useless (except maybe in bossfights when you want a mass-heal/revive/etc.) and don't really add interesting choices. There was no preparation for fights (by changing gear or buffs - the latter do not exist). The whole combat mostly revolved around focusing on a specific enemy and bringing it down as soon as possible, rather than playing around with the status effects - which mostly comes down to the size of the fights, 4v4-6. There are too many enemies, too much stuff going on to make reliable use of statuses.The UI around equipping, buying and using items is absolutely atrocious. It's difficult to compare items, each time you use one it closes the menu and forgets the context so that you need to reopen the inventory, search for the item, reselect the character, etc.; in general, it's very poorly designed and implemented (some numbers reset back to 0 before being updated to the correct value, for example).The overworld traveling system is also terrible. Especially the fact that if you die and go back to the afterlife, you lose access to the ship and must walk to an island in the center of the map to recall your airship. I mean... why not just let you recall the ship at any landing pad? There is no added benefit or interesting mechanic flowing from this forced recalling of the airship at the central island. It just makes navigation a pain.The story, as previously, is largely nonsensical.I actually enjoyed the writing in the beginning - despite the invented words, there was a kind of facetious wisdom in the characters' lines. Until \"the thing\" happened. And, either way, the plot is non-sense. Go here, get ally, go there, kill bad guy.Finally, there are really annoying maze-like areas. They are sprawling and senseless. I get that's part of what the game has going for it, but they are still annoying rather than just weird.The 2 platforming levels fit this non-sensical sprawl, but I enjoyed them. ",

        "text": "Obviously very good and you don't need me to tell you that.Honestly, the story was a bit disappointing - I somehow find Pyre more successful in crafting a story through the \"in-between moments\", and especially more compelling characters.Here, every character just seemed to be \"always there\" (sometimes not, but at random, not because they had a reason) for a few extra lines of chitchat.And the progression too, was designed around repetition - way too much of it for my taste. You are suppose to go through many permutations and try every ability and so on for the \"story\" to proceed. It's less about being driven to achieve a specific objective and more just trying everything, exhaustively.That said, it's by far the best Supergiant game in terms of raw gameplay. It won't surprise you if you've played Bastion and Transistor, but it's far more refined and punchy.And the music, as usual, doesn't disappoint.So yea, if you're still on the fence, somehow, definitely give it a shot.",

        "text": "Had my eye on it for a while, as the photographing mechanic seemed novel, and the artstyle unique.Well, big disappointment, I'm afraid.The biggest problem I have with the game is with how crude it is. I sometimes like low-fi aesthetics, but in this case it goes directly against core of the game - text becomes insanely aliased when it is very important for the political message, the platforming is very buggy (with the character getting stuck whenever it collides with something, the double jump being finicky and momentum based, some things look like platforming but turn out to have no collider, etc.) and even the photo mechanic, when it's about capturing specific objects is too permissive and you can easily take a picture of a special objective by mistake - sometimes while the object is obscured by something else.The platforming is the biggest frustration, because the levels seem built with a lot of verticality and I could imagine myself have fun *exploring* them - but they have nothing to explore and are very basic. Whatever platforming seems interesting and free - as when you try to climb high - turns out disappointing when there are misleading platforms without colliders or simply no reason for you to get to the tricky spots in the first place.And it's just floaty and unpolished in general.Other than this, the game is just a series of levels with objectives and just about nothing else. The bonus objectives are always the same (go quickly, make money, find X of this tiny irrelevant item spread throughout). It tries to give you more mechanics with different lenses and so on, but they don't have much of a purpose. As a game, it goes through the motions without getting anywhere.The political message, finally, mostly goes over my head. Basically, \"UN is bad\". I'm sure there is more to it in the way the levels are arranged, in sequence, the characters and themes portrayed, and so on. But the core of the game is so unsatisfying to me that I can't be bothered. I'll admit this particular complaint may be more on me than on the game.Finally, the aesthetic is cool. The music, especially - reminds me of Lethal League, in a very good way. But not enough to save it.Perhaps I'm simply in the wrong mindspace for the game, but it really failed to capture me, and instead the crudeness of the most basic game elements marked the majority of the experience. I've played 4 levels, and I think I've had enough.",

        "text": "Very nice little game.It's a cozy, wholesome 3D platformer. You jump and glide around, collect things, and do little errands for the characters, getting involved in their little schemes and dramas.There isn't much to it - all you do is jump, double jump, and hold to glide. Those are the mechanics, and they're all available from the very beginning. You can go anywhere right away - except for the endgame. Which is what I did. I love this kind of freedom in 3D platformers (I recently played Grow Up which played similarly, in this respect).There is no real challenge in the game. Everything progressed rather naturally, without ever getting stuck looking for a needle in a haystack, which is good. And it doesn't overstay its welcome at all - 2.5 hours to fully complete it was just the right length. It looks great, like a modern ps1 game (none of the visual artifacts that so many try to emulate these days), and the music complements it well. The controls felt great, for the most part - the only bugginess, to me, was when switching between modes (say, moving and dialog), where sometimes the game would \"forget\" to give you back move controls (usually due to an achievement pop-up as you exited a conversation). But these were solved by simply talking to the character in front of you again, so no harm no foul.The falling animation was a bit weird, the way the character was stretched, but this is a nitpick.Another nitpick - the end-game gate character is too easily accessible. It was one of the first characters I met, though I needed to \"collect stamps\" before advancing. This is fine, but it did take away from the late game, where I finished various characters' tasks and was rewarded with info about where the endgame was located - which I had known from the very beginning.Final nitpick - one of the early characters in the game very excitedly says that comets are like flying stars - come on! Let's foster wonder through truth, instead. :)That's about all I have to say. This is what I'd like to see from Sokpop - small games that nonetheless feel complete and reasonably polished. They could be shorter, 30 minutes, or so, but still have a full and satisfying journey from beginning to end.If you enjoy cozy and relaxing platformers, definitely give this a go. It was an afternoon well spent, winding down.",

        "text": "Kinda cool idea, with neat presentation, but it's way too crude and unpolished to be worth playing. The minions get stuck all the time, the rules are unclear (especially about minion growth), and even the AI sometimes just stands there doing nothing.I don't like it when I complete the campaign and still have very little idea about the game's rules - whether I win or lose, the outcome seems rather arbitrary. Did I do something right, was I just lucky that the way bugged out, or perhaps I simply got a better starting map position? I couldn't really tell you.I like the idea of Sokpop, but the more games I play, the more they seem glorified game jam games. They have all the veneer of a proper game, it looks good on video, but once you start to play them, you suddenly realize how very little time was spent on the design. Rules are unclear, there are imbalances all over the place, etc.; ",

        "text": "I usually enjoy older games, but this one dated horribly.Not only is the point n click interaction terribly clunky, the combat starts by having you (and enemies) miss 70% of your hits (I am not exaggerating). After 3 or 4 hours, if you put all your points into dexterity, you'll only miss about 40% of the time (which feels like heaven in comparison). Except that, at that point, the game decides that it would be very nice to throw enemies at you that get intermittently invisible, which means you can't target them, half of the time. Oh, and they also run away when they have low health, so you'll chase them around, clunkily stop your run animation when attacking, which misses while they run away even farther.Just... no.It might get better later, but the game has given me absolutely no reason to keep playing, at this point.Having more party members doesn't help, because the combat isn't at all squad based like baldur's gate or dragon age. In fact, they get in the way, and often die pointlessly. Their only redeeming feature is the extra inventory space.There is no real strategy to the combat, it's largely just mashing auto-attack. The second boss I fought (which was a bit difficult) was just a matter of restarting until it missed more than me so that it died first.Some of the quests are equally irrelevant. Here's one of the last: \"go from castle to cemetery to have a hunchback tell you you need a goblet of blood to enter the tunnels, so you run back to the university (which is back on the way to the castle), the lady simply gives you the goblet, and you run back to the hunchback and yea, ok, you can enter the tunnels now\".How was this interaction relevant in any way? It wasn't, it's just disrespectful padding.Soooo yeah. I've got better things to do with my time.Hopefully Bloodlines will be better.",

Essentially, in 2 hours you can reach the \"endgame\" zone, but they you realize you've missed some ship parts along the way and need to go back to collect them.This becomes a \"needle in a haystack\" problem, a bit.Soooo yea. From what I remember (it's been many years), the first game was much more satisfying, better paced.That said, I love what these two games do. There is a real sense of freedom, being able to go anywhere you can see, exploring nooks and crannies, climbing, flying around. It's wholesome and great.I'd fully recommend the first game as something special - something rare.

        "text": "Second Sokpop game I've played, and I'm afraid I'm still not impressed.I guess being so prolific comes at a cost - the games end up being little more than a \"first draft\", with all the awkward and undercooked design that entails.Berry People is about going around a map taking photos of berry people. These are almost always round smiley faces with a star-shaped leaf on their head - different colors are about as much character as you can expect to them.There are 100 of these, I have successfully photographed 97; after going around the whole map once more, I decided I wasn't getting anything out of it, so I dropped it.The biggest is that the berries lack unique behaviour, for the most part. Most stand around, some run around, a select few hide when you get too close or are hidden/camouflaged.But it's not as if you need to learn the specific behaviour of a berry to take a photo or anything. Most of the time, if you missed one, it is simply because you passed it by and forgot to take a picture, or perhaps it was behind a bush - nothing too interesting.There is a hint of a better game underneath - perhaps you're trying to catch urban legends based on rumours, where behaviours and clues matter. There are perfect and \"normal\". These have to do with framing, proximity and facing. Some of the berries are awkwardly placed, so the \"perfect\" photo actually looks worse than a normal one.Your camera's roll is also very limited - with 5 or so photos - so you need to go back to a revealer, at which point you place the new photos in the book. This can be annoying, at times, but I think it ends up being the lesser evil - almost every map has one, and it prevents you from overcrowding your camera's memory, which would make sorting and cataloging them pure hell later on.That's about it for the game, really. The maps aren't too interesting. Maybe there is a pond, a well, or a posh courtyard, but most things look the same.The photobook is terribly designed, too, especially at the start. Although there is a specific spot for each berry, this isn't clear at the beginning. If you have two photos of the same berry, the book flips between the correct spot and the last page, where you can place any random photos you want; but it looks like random and buggy flipping. The design is very awkward, again, because it is a first draft.The secret room is nice, the feel of the game is very wholesome, and the the binoculars are a nice detail (where you can a distant parallaxed scene).It's not terribly, it's just... innocuous? It doesn't add anything to do the table, and the actual game part (taking photos of specific things) has no substance to it.",

        "text": "Really disappointing.I have never played an auto-battler before, but this doesn't seem like a good example of one.The UI is very poor, with hitboxes for hovering feeling finicky and not updating when, for example, units move in the course of battle (the hover shows the previous unit until you move the mouse out and in again).There is no fast-forward feature during battle (which is terrible in the beginning of the game, since it is both difficult and grindy, as you don't have any real skills or items to try out different builds).The inventory UI is also clunky.Ultimately, I guess this is a auto-battler that emphasises the idling part (i.e. waiting for battles to end in the background, and repeated grind) rather than the build creation part (i.e. what requires meaningful engagement with the player).It is inherently misguided.Sooo yeah.

        "text": "This is the best game I've played in a long time.In some ways, it seems tailored for me - as we share many of the same influences.I don't read comics, but the ones I did read and love are Moebius and Obscure Cities, both of which are clear influences on the game's visuals; BLAME! is another, on the manga side.I'm also a huge fan of Ted Chiang's Tower of Babylon story - one about a tower so tall that the peoples at various heights develop very different (you could say unintelligible) cultures. And, of course, there's \"Story of Your Life\" about deciphering an alien language, the basis for the movie Arrival.There's even a hint of Piranesi and Escher towards the end of the game.Above all, though, it's an extremely well made game. Each culture in the game has its own distinct ideology and game mechanics, which go hand in hand.Various ways of creating language and writing systems are used to create game mechanics in ways that aren't merely thematic - the languages are functional and you really must understand them in order to solve (at least some) of the puzzles. It is very unlike many games nowadays, which user a certain theme as a thin skin under which everything is automated and filled by the game so that you don't really need to understand mechanics in order to finish the game.I have played a bit of \"Heaven's Vault\", which I think falls into the trap I described above. You never really have to understand of piece together the language yourself. Instead, you just navigate around the map, collect words, choose \"meanings\" at random, and the game tells you what is right or wrong, so you just change the wrong ones into another arbitrary meaning until they all click.I think it was a laudable effort, but ended up being too long and unrewarding and I dropped it after maybe 12 hours.Chants of Sennaar takes a similar idea but executes it in a far better way. I mean mechanically, above all, but every other element is also really well done, so kudos to the small team.For example, there are several kinds of \"rosetta stones\" in the game, to help you figure out one language from another. These clues are, of course, not complete, but they help you at the start.One language is unique is its treatment of numbers, so you'll need to figure out how digits are composed.Different languages treat word order differently, or how plurals are written, and so on.Maybe verbs and nouns have a different overall shape, or maybe you can compose symbols together to form more complex ones.The game's ideas are simple, but very effective. And they come together beautifully.Without spoiling anything, I'm also happy to say that the game does have a message, which only becomes clear later on. Of course, it's difficult to provide an adequate payoff after 10+ hours of game, so I can't say the ending will change your world, but it is nice and again, very well executed.The one aspect I must admit irked me a bit is how \"real cultures\" are used to represent what are very stereotypical cultures within the game. I'm perfectly okay with using stereotypes to convey a message, but not so much when those stereotypes are superimposed on real cultures (which do not conform to such a stereotype).An example is how the warrior culture clearly takes imagery from the \"vikings\", as violent sea-farers who write in runes.The bards, too, clearly take after india, with a sanskrit-esque alphabet (edit: I should have said \"devanagari\" writing system; sanskrit is the language, not the writing system, and it doesn't seem to be an actual alphabet, but hey, my ignorance is not that relevant to the point :)) and a very recognizably indian violin and table-esque drum in the soundtrack (although this is only really noticeable in the first scene).There are other strange choices here and there, like how the most advanced culture in the game, technologically, architecturally takes after Timbuktu's adobe buildings.This is really a very minor point, though. Most of the time, the game does look unique, and the effort was clearly there (unlike most fantasy games which use a mixture of gothic arches and art noveau ornament for elves, and every ancient ruin looks greek and roman).There was also one or two points in the game where I think things could have been a bit clearer; but, overall, I am extremely impressed with how smooth everything was, given how unique and ambitious the design is.If any of what I wrote sounds intriguing, please buy it. It's an extremely good game which deserves all the praise and attention it can get!",

        "text": "Well, this was a disappointment.Fallout 1 (and 2) are some of my favourite games ever. There is a lot of Fallout here, superficially, but the game is so, so tame in most respects.First, there's the gameplay. The game is full of \"busywork\", of \"stuff\" that serves little purpose. I feel like I spent maybe 30-40% of my time just looting every highlighted item and occasionally going back to town, interrupting gameplay, to empty my bags.The game has a crafting system, stat-modifying consumables, and companions with skill trees - despite playing on Hard mode, I've had just about 0 need to take any of this into account. I did upgrade weapons, but mostly just levelling them up. I barely touched armor, and I didn't bother to really change the companions' gear, I felt no need. And the consumables - well, I occasionally used one that increased your backpack capacity for a minute, just so I could run to the nearest shop.Damage types, changing gear before facing certain enemies, thinking about how companions boost your stats - none of this mattered. Which makes the vast majority of systems (and looting) serve no point.It's just there because it's something that games have. Probably makes them sell, since players compulsively enjoy hoarding (I include myself in this), on a base level; still, it doesn't nourish and leaves you with an empty stomach (and head) by the end of the game.Second, while I was initially very pleasantly surprised about the role that \"anarchism\" seems to play in the game, that surprise was quickly turned into dismay, when the writing showed that it didn't understand anarchism at all.I didn't expect it to be a fair treatment - given that capitalism is taken in the most satirical and cynical possible way, anarchism could as well (even though anarchism has no \"clear/serious\" presence in most people's minds, so a satire of it doesn't help); but even when the game suggests that siding with the rebels is the \"correct\" action, it does so in the most tame possible way, and often ignores the anarchism aspect entirely.In fact, every anarchist character is revealed to be a \"fake anarchist\" and is actually just a self-interesting knucklehead.There's the good doctor who somehow threatens you for badmouthing their \"leader\" (yes, very anarchist); the charismatic new age woo-woo leader who is actually an anarchist out of guilt for his murderous past and refuses to stand down because this is \"his colony\"; the pirate who asks you to kill an informant but, oh, wait, the pirate himself was dealing with the board.Only the gardener of the first town seems to be a reasonable anarchist, and even she was painted in a negative light because using \"human bodies as fertilizer\" is a bad thing. Because... why? Because \"ew\", I guess.And, don't forget, every anarchist wants to blow things up.Of course, at the end of the game, you become the leader. Because why not? You don't even get a choice in the matter.In general, too, the writing was far to abstract and simplistic. You could almost not read the text at all and simply choose your answers based on stat checks. Plus, the solutions all follow the simple pattern: side with the capitalists (bad), side with the anarchists (worse), work out a compromise that leaves the capitalists mostly in power but slightly shifts the balance towards worker-fairness and so on (often provided by the anarchists).There is a lot more I could say about it, but it will take some time for me to organize my thoughts. So I'll end it here, for now, with the two or three most important points. Aside from that, the game can be beautiful (although the scenes are a bit too busy at times). Some of the writing can be very funny, and sharp. The advertisements are great. The clouds very beautiful.It is a polished AAA title, it plays well. But it adds almost nothing to the table, and it deeply screws up in the writing department, when it reveals that either the writers didn't know enough to take the subject seriously, or it didn't work for the gameplay and so whatever the original intent, it slept on Procrustes bed before being incorporated into the game.

        "text": "Unexpectedly good lovecraftian story! Aside from the framing (and ending) it is rather derivative, but it mostly \"gets\" lovecraft, or at least a self-sufficient part of it.The game also looks amazing - sometimes a bit rough, but the scenes presented more than make up for it.Unfortunately, the game design is... mediocre, at best?The problem is that the \"puzzles\" are more like riddles, and have absolutely nothing to do with the theme of the game, most of the time.It's the most egregious example of \"game logic\" I've seen in a long time. You're often just turning lever for no other reason other than that they're there and you know something will open up once you turn them all correctly.Beyond that, the obstacles are pointlessly obtuse and serve no purpose other than to fill the time and serve as an excuse to call it a puzzle game rather than a walking simulator.There is rarely any mechanic build-up or progression, each puzzle relying on a different and arbitrary set of rules.Sometimes, you are also forced to walk back and forth to turn things on and off, again, for no reason.Finally, there is one aspect that annoyed me greatly - you are given clues through in-games notes and so on. However, instead of the game trusting the player to figure things out (or to fine-tune the clues to make sure they will unambiguously lead to the correct solution), the designers rely on an auto-completed \"notebook\" which displays the right clues and information needed. This means you rarely need to think about what you find in the world. Instead, you turn your brain off, walk around interacting with everything (that has an interaction icon) and, in the end, look on the notebook for the steps to solve the puzzle.Just to give a particularly infuriating puzzle example (spoilers ahead):- you need to play a \"stone organ\", whose pipes are opened or closed by some pillars with a symbol on them, identifying the note. So far, so good.- however, the symbols on the pillars are not the \"real\" symbols, instead they are shuffled, exchanged by other symbols. This transformation is somewhere else entirely, on a slide show. Also, there are several transformations, and the correct one depends on the height of the tide (because why not?).- which notes to play? Well, that is revealed is two other parts of the island: (1) you need to solve a floating stone puzzle that will give you 3 random numbers (frequencies); (2) in another part of the island, there is a piano keyboard which reveals a number when you play a specific note.- finally, on the rock organ, you need to play the notes that produce the frequencies from the floating stone puzzle, except that they are also shuffled by the tide.This, of course, all involves walking to and fro, very slowly.There could be other examples (although not as full of indirection).The general point, however, is this: there is no internal logic the game. It's all \"magic\". You do things because you know the game will respond to it, even though there is no explanation or reason for them. There is no understanding underneath. There is no relation to the themes or writing.So yeah. I felt like the puzzles, or \"riddles\", were awful and pointless.If you can tolerate those, and you enjoy Lovecraft (in the sense of superstition, heredity, xenophobia, archaeology and dreams), there is an impressively looking game underneath, with a nice, if derivative, plot.I'm giving it a positive just because the latter elements were a positive surprise.",

        "text": "Much better than Skeletal Avenger and Undead Horde, in my view.Still uncommitted to the full rogue-lite upgrade system, but the weapons are more fun than it those games, gives the chain-lighting fun of the tesla theme.There are some persistent upgrades, but they are not as obviously required as in the two games mentioned above. Can still get grindy to get them, but you're less reliant on them (and more reliant on which perks and weapons you get on a run).Not the most inspired game, by any means, and I still prefer Neon Chrome a Jydge to this, by a country mile. Those game had a lot more variety and customization. It felt like you were trying to figure out good enough builds and overcoming specific challenges rather than just grinding to replay the same levels on higher difficulties, as 10tons seem to have been doing since then.The game wants you to replay it at higher difficulties, which I don't find very fun at all - especially given the low variety of weapons and perks. I've beaten the game once, on the first difficult, and I feel like I've seen 80% of what is has to show. At this point, it would likely get grindier than I'm comfortable with.Still, I enjoyed it during that first run. Take that as you will.",

        "text": "It's an okay metroidvania. Won't blow you away, doesn't do anything particularly interesting, but it's a solid game.Although a bit on the easy side, it has nice, if basic, bossfights.The map design was the biggest letdown, for me. It felt very unstructured, and I feel like I was often just exploring rooms at random without getting any new ability or fighting any new boss, often stumbling onto new areas before I \"finished\" the current one. Also not that many places that made me go \"oh, I must need a power-up to get through\" or \"ah-hah, so that's how I reach that\" after getting a power-up. Meandering is the best way to describe it.I also dislike the message of the game. Of the story, anyway. Basically, \"humans over populated and over explored the planet, and overreached with technology and, God forbid, disturbed the *natural equilibrium*\", so dumb robots rule the world, and are somehow infected by a nondescript evil virus to make the world doubly apocalyptic.It's neither about caution nor about creative problem, but about timidity and resignation. Finally - I made a mistake playing this game. I remembered a \"pastel-colored metroidvania whose name was a japanese word\", from a few years ago. That game had a really cool lighting system, based on a palette change, and I wanted to play it, at some point. When I saw this, \"Haiku\", I assumed (pardon my naivete) that was the game and added to my wishlist.To my disappointment, there's no cool lighting system, here! Turns out there is ANOTHER \"pastel-colored metroidvania whose name was a japanese word\". That's \"Kunai\".Oh well.There are worse mistakes.As I said, the game is quite solid, if not stellar or innovative. Fun for a few mindless hours. ",

        "text": "It's a good game, if not great.Love the architecture, and love the general approach about learning about the city, its inhabitants, and actions you can take in each subsequent \"loop\".It is also steeped in greek and roman myths and history (even Diogenes makes an appearance, of sorts), which is nice.In some ways, it is very like Outer Wilds, although much shorter and mechanically simpler. It also relies on specific items (either real inventory items or \"knowledge\" items which are stored by the game) to measure your \"progress\" and open up new paths. In this respect, I preferred Outer Wilds, since it was purely about the knowledge acquired as the players, rather than the \"knowledge\" acquired by the \"player character\".It is also a bit too undemanding. The big solution to the mystery isn't discovered through any particular deduction of involvement of the player with an active mind, but simply following quest crumbs that will reveal everything rather \"mechanically\".Still. The above simply exemplifies how it falls short of what I would consider a really great game. This is still a good and enjoyable one!There was one rather unnecessary action sequence which didn't serve the game very well (long, very easy, and meaningless).I must also say I found the endings a bit underwhelming. In particular, how there was really only one \"proper\", canonical ending. At the end of the day, the game is about finding the one true solution, rather than presenting a problem with different ones (even if one could be more satisfying).To end on a bright note, I really enjoyed the writing. The characters really had their own personalities, and there were several very wholesome threads and relationships in the game. At the end of the day, nothing very innovative, mechanically, but it does manage to create a very compelling experience without relying on brute force. You get to visit a beautiful place, steeped in myth, full of human characters. I look forward to more games like this, and sincerely hope others will build upon on it.",

        "text": "Very good atmosphere and artstyle.World-building is nice as well, if a little... nihilistic? Though there are traces of something more in the end. :)There is a hint of Tsutomu Nihei, for sure, but also not quite the same. Perhaps psychologically similar to BLAME!, but not architecturally (and those two really go together brilliantly in BLAME!, in my view).As far as upgrades (read weapons) go, it is fairly unimaginative. No platforming abilities to speak of, either. The weapons do make the bosses somewhat interesting: as your ammo and health are very limited for those fights, you need to pick the appropriate weapons for each boss. Unfortunately, this never gets very deep, because there are only 3 or 4 bosses.I liked the no-map aspect. The world isn't very large, so you can map it out in your head. There is also good application of shortcuts (ladders you can lower and the like). So halfway between a traditional metroidvania and a souls-like game.The difficulty could be a bit too high, at times. Mostly because of sparse checkpoint placement and ammo. I found myself repeating the same section over and over just because the way to the \"real\" obstacle was full of unavoidable enemies, forcing me to spend time and patience, only to die at the end.This was in one of the last two sections of the game, however, so fair enough.Won't change your life, but it is a solid enough game!",

Later on, some sections have an RTS-like aspect with towers that deal heavy damage and buildings that spawn enemy units, but even those are largely about brute forcing it.The whole game is almost entirely lacking in strategy. There is very little experimentation with different units, and, as you level up, you often unlock just ridiculously better versions of previous units instead of genuinely new ones.There are *some* new units (around the 3 hour mark, I did get an interesting giant and healer combination), so it is possible that the game gets better later on. That said, thus far it is rather grindy and unimaginative, in a way that I don't feel like spending any more time on it.Writing is lighthearted and okay. Mostly skeleton-name puns.Game doesn't look too good.Equipment isn't very interesting, and largely just a dump for gold as you upgrade the shops before you can get good stuff.Disappointing, for sure. Especially as I really enjoyed both Jydge and Neon Chrome. Those games had a cool selection of weapons, perks, and tight level design that forced you to experiment.

        "text": "It's a cool game, but, as others have said, it is \"too little\". I don't mean length, because short games game be complete and fully explore whatever it is they are trying to.This one, however, does not.There isn't enough room for the mechanics to build up to a very meaningful height, and it actually seems quite timid, in a way, with its short length - I feel like it avoids depth and complexity as a way of evading the design problems.It's a detective game, where you question people and collect evidence in order to find the culprit of three murders.The evidence collection is trivial, as you just walk around and click every object that becomes highlighted (one missed opportunity would be to use some piece of evidence as a clue of what to look for next, and so on).The meat of the game is in cross-questioning the suspects. There are only 2-3 in each mission.You gather their testimonies, and they will lie. Where their accounts differ, you can highlight a contradiction; similarly if they counter the evidence. As you go along, some claims become \"verified\", which you use to find further contradictions.This is the core of the game. There are some sprinklings of other mechanics, like \"seeing through the character's core\" to find psychological concepts of each character, but these are really very minor and not very relevant.But not all goes smoothly, and this is the biggest problem, and, I think, reason for the game's short length - the interactions can become a bit obtuse, which would fall apart in larger and more complex cases.I was often stuck wondering exactly how the game wanted me to present the evidence for contradictions. Like, I clearly saw what the contradiction was, but I could not figure out how to tell it to the game.You can also skip a huge part of the process of finding contradictions and the like by trial and error - since you can accuse any character at any moment, you only need a minimal set of evidence to solve the case.There is no penalty whatsoever for accusing the wrong person, or trying to claim a non-existent contradiction. I feel like this undermines the whole idea, to be honest.Finally, each case ends with you identifying which \"daemon\" led to the crime. This part is absolutely trivial. The choice was always extremely obvious. And, again, no penalty. There are like 5 demons in total, so you can easily just pick one after the other to find the solution.In general, the writing was a bit awkward. I don't see why everybody has to lie about everything all the time. The little twist at the end was a nice touch, however.The artstyle and music are also quite good.Not much more to say about it. I am glad the game exists and that it tries a new set of mechanics! But it is ultimately little more than a polished proof of concept that fails to break new ground.",

        "text": "Compared to Rogue:Genesia, I much prefer the way the enemies move, here. They don't chase your current position, but your position when they were last \"aggroed\", which only resets once they reach it. This makes the dodging a lot more interesting, somehow. You have more control, and yet it can create tricky situations.It comes much closer to nailing the Castlevania aesthetic than VS, with a more modern approach to pixel art and VFX. Only issue comes from the trees, which hide enemies - a terrible design decision, imo.The level design is much poorer (or, rather, almost inexistent), and the last bosses (of the first stage, which is all I played) are ridiculously spongy, even with the basic stat upgrades maxed.The upgrade system is completely out of whack, too. It is extremely convoluted and nothing is clearly explained (runes, companions, glyphs, stats, etc.). Some of the system are also far more expensive than others for no discernible reason.I like the classes, which feel much more unique than VS. Unfortunately, however, the game is severely lacking in weapons and synergies. Every run plays out essentially the same, which is a big disappointment.Overall, I think it has great aesthetics and improves on the basic gameplay. But I definitely don't think it is worth playing at its current stage. Perhaps in a few months... ",

        "text": "Cool attempt to structure the story in a way that works in a rogue-lite: the story plays out over time (unfortunately independently of player actions), as the story of the Bergson family. Its members are the characters you play as, and more members arrive to fight the corruption, opening up more options over time. This is good, and unique.Unfortunately, the structure of the gameplay uses rogue-lite in precisely the wrong way: instead of providing interesting opportunities to experiments with builds during runs (with randomization, etc.), the game relies mostly on grind and permanent upgrades.You gain experience during a run, which you use to unlock skills in a skill tree (permanent, per character), and you gain gold which you use to buy stat upgrades (permanent, across characters).The items and upgrades you get in each run change very very little and you don't really have much control over it. You're just going through the motions and hoping you get a half useful item that gives you a very marginal advantage. No cool synergies or anything game changing at all.There are some flavourful random events during runs, but they're not particularly relevant or interesting (to me, anyway).The artstyle is also a mixed bag. While some of it is really cool and intricate, it uses way too much color, at time, which becomes a bit crowded. They also use pixel art terribly, with free camera motion and zoom, which distorts the pixels and looks terribly jittery in motion.Some minor bugs and annoyances in targetting and hitboxes, but I can live with it.Game also lacks a sufficiently strong mechanism to encourage playing different characters. It seems that most of the them aren't useful at all, in most circumstances, so I played mostly 2 or 3, repeatedly. Overall, I liked the way they tried something new with the story (although it was very disappointing that there was no player role at all, and everything just played itself out automatically).The gameplay, unfortunately, was very lackluster, in the long run. It's okay, it can be enjoyable, but it doesn't really do anything to deserve sustained attention.",

        "text": "Note: this is a review of the game in isolation, not as part of the \"vampire survivors genre\". Perhaps most of my complaints will simply apply to the genre as a whole.Rogue: Genesia is very addictive (I don't see this as a good thing, necessarily), ultimately a merge between a clicker and a slot machine - without the clicking.In each run (the term never applied better, as all you do is indeed run), you choose upgrades from a random selection, hoping that your numbers grow faster than the enemies'. The game is divided into \"ranks\". Each rank is kind of a difficulty level, and has its own permanent meta-upgrades (costing ever more).The first two ranks are laughably easy (it's difficult to lose), while the third rank increases the difficulty a lot, requiring either luck or some meta-upgrades to even begin tackling.Not sure if there are ranks beyond the third (I haven't beaten it, though got close and made one fatal mistake).The biggest problem is that you only surpass this difficulty increase through grind - by buying the meta-upgrades.And, ultimately, a \"good\" run is a run in which you're completely melting enemies. There's barely any actual gameplay in these situations. And if you are not melting enemies, it is largely something you can overcome by just grinding a bit for the meta-upgrades.That said, there are things I liked. I prefer the level structure, when compared to VS. You have a node map as in Slay the Spire, so it gives you some measure of control.I also like the ability to get re-rolls and banish charges, thus pruning the randomized tree of abilities somewhat.The most disappointing aspect is that there doesn't seem to be much build planning or synergy. Obviously, you can make terrible choices that constantly undermine each other, but, most of the time, upgrades are just good overall and the abilities don't seem to interact much (there are a couple of exceptions).I don't know. As I said, it is addictive and satisfying, but in a very... unethical (?) level. It is a kind of predatory system, the same one used to get people addicted in casinos. It doesn't really expand on game design, quite the contrary - it removes most of the elements and degenerates into a dopamine rush of coin/shard collecting and the upgrade slot machine.Update: I played a bit more, offline. I've beaten the d-rank 2 or 3 times since then, out of 3 or 4 tries. Not because I got better, mind you, but because the failed run let me upgrade to the point of being strong enough. There is no c-rank runs, so I guess this is the current difficulty ceiling of the game, which you hit in maybe 4 hours.I've also tried some of the initial challenges - they are cool, in a sense. They apply heavy constraints (like no upgrades on end level, no shops, etc.), and give you a special meta-upgrade in return. The idea is nice.Unfortunately, the rest of the design works against it. If you find a challenge too difficult, it most likely means you need to grind more meta-upgrades, not learn to play better or make better decisions.I am moving on, now, but it would be interesting to do a run picking upgrades literally at random. I am almost certain the outcome would not be much different. It seems all smoke and mirrors. It is satisfying to melt enemies and collect the shiny little gems, but there is no substance underneath. Not my idea of a meaningful experience, but hey. ",

        "text": "Aesthetically excellent, I love both the UI and the world rendering, the smooth transition between zoom levels, and the visual effect of the slow terraforming.Mechanically okay - doesn't stray very far from similar games, like Surviving Mars, though it has less hazards and may be too \"hands-off\", degenerating into a waiting game later on.I played it on release and it had game-breaking problems in the working drones in the mid-to-late game. The colony would fall apart due to drones getting stuck in incorrect tasks. I'm happy to say it has since been resolved, and I've played the campaign from start to finish without issue.Managing a single \"colony\" is fine, but when you get the option to add additional and isolated \"landings\", things kind of fall apart. The new colonies are very slow to get going (requiring the same loop and build order every time, and the resources produced/demanded become unclear for each specific colony). This should have really been solved with an additional mechanic to start a colony with more resources (even if it cost more to prepare them before deployment). Narratively ambitious - but ultimately unsuccessful, and this unfortunately kind of kills the game. The game tries to tell a good old science fiction story, in the classic sense, and I love it for it. If it succeeded, it could be a truly unique entry in the genre, a must-play.But the narrative isn't well implemented with the gameplay in several respects:- the pacing is completely off, with segments very dense with narrative, followed by long (hours) periods without any narrative; - parallel plot lines can get out of sync, so the same character is speaking to you very angrily in one moment, almost severing relations, and seconds later it is talking to you as if nothing had happened, kindly telling you something about a mission; - the game gives the illusion of choice (especially when it comes to combat, attacking a colony or not), but it completely ignores your actual actions. The dialogue asks you for an opinion, and at one point reprimands you for a past action, like attacking a colony. But right afterward, if you refuse to attack, the game doesn't acknowledge it at all; in fact, the colony you were supposed to attack vanishes completely once you reach a new terraforming stage, and the dialogue plays out as if you had attacked it. It's really badly implemented - and this may also have been one reason for the bad pacing; maybe the game was waiting for me to attack to advance the story. Needless to say, the opposing colony presented to real threat, as I had more than sufficient defenses, so it posed no threat, and thus no real imperative for me to attack.Ultimately, the problems are two fold: - pacing and sync issues (for example, at some point I reached stage 5 of terraforming, but the story was congratulating me on finishing stage 4);- treating the player as an agent with free will, but then not providing any actual mechanical choice, instead expecting a single choice and ignoring any other action.Soooo yeah. I'll still give it a positive because I kind of enjoyed my time with it, and I am interested in what they come up with next. I fully support its ambition, but am forced to recognize how it fails to realize it.",

        "text": "Original review exceeded Steam's word limit, so here's a synthesized version.By far the most enjoyable ACE Team game, for me!I've replayed the first two Zeno Clash games in preparation for this, and the gameplay is vastly improved in every way. It's bolder and better.The combat is less unique, but more fun.The writing, disappointingly, doesn't really take the Zenozoik story in any new direction, but it is a much more eloquent treatment of the same themes, with tenuous connections to the other games. Certainly much better for new players, but I would have really liked to see more movement to the Zenozoik story - guess I'll have to wait for a sequel.Visually, too, it's far better, although I am not fully on board with the style - while I love the textural feel of it, it feels a bit *too* textural for a Zenozoik game, which relied more on quirky and identifiable models, if that makes sense.The music is very unique, and quite good, but once again feels a bit off for Zenozoik. The previous games used unique \"ethnic\" instruments to convey the culturally-alien (Xeno) nature of the games, which I really liked.This time around, voice and piano are very prominent - the voice is cool and unconventional, but the piano takes out some of the alien feeling, to me. Now, brief discussion around specific subjects:--- Souls-like & Exploration ---I feel like this is a misleading labelling. The game is neither difficult nor mechanically deep. What it does take from Souls, however, is the open level-design and the lack of a GPS system. I love this, and exploration was by far my favourite part of the game.The whole world is fully connected, and you need to rely on (and develop) your navigational skills alone, not following an icon on a map. Many paths are initially closed off, in each area, but you will open them up as you explore (in the riskier night form) as well as the connecting shortcuts across areas.The areas are very... maze-like, which is a positive and a negative. On the plus side, it's really cool to map out in your head and explore when you reach a new area, for sure. There is also a lot to collect in every nook and cranny (equipment, ingredients, stance and attacks, upgrades, etc.).On the minus side, it's a pain to backtrack through, and this really hurts the \"end/post-game\" if you're one to look for optional bosses and equipment. While in Dark Souls you're navigating very distinct areas, most of the time (ruins, buildings, etc.), here, being mostly \"alien nature\", it is difficult to remember where things were. Plus, when exploring the first time, it's easy to identify where you have been before (since everything is collected), but once you return, most things have already been picked up, so it can become more confusing.--- Skill points, Difficulty ---This is an interesting design problem that I did not expect to have.In Dark Souls, souls are the currency for everything, and they are risky to carry with you, since you lose them upon death. This makes levelling up very encouraged.In here, you level up through XP and keep your skill points for ever. This made me hold on to them. \"Too good to use syndrome\". By the end of the game, I had spent maybe 30 points, and had 90 points leftover, unspent.This brings me to discuss difficulty - the game is far too easy, after first few hours. It undervalues every other system in the game. Equipment will maybe give you 20-30 extra points, at most.Potion brewing, too, was too subtle and problematically opaque (next section) to be relevant.Weapons could be used, but their lack of integration into the combos made them awkward to use.And worst of all, this lack of difficulty applies also to the optional dark bosses. I also feel like optional content is a great opportunity to force players to delve deep into the game's system, to demand them to learn and use everything to their advantage in order to overcome the challenge. None of that here, a wasted opportunity.--- Crafting and Brewing ---This is a huge design problem.You get crafting materials from enemies and use them to purchase equipment and ritual upgrades. Enemies respawn \"infinitely\" so you never run out of materials; but shops' stocks are limited, they have a finite use.You get ingredients by gathering them in the world, but they do *not* respawn, so they have a finite supply. But, depending on how well you play, how much you explore, you may need to craft many potions. Beyond that, the brewing system is extremely opaque and unclear, making blind trial and error a necessity to learn it. You can imagine how blind experimentation and finite supply can go wrong.I don't know how this happened, but wires got crossed. Crafting supplies, having finite demand, could have had finite supply. Brewing ingredients, with infinite demand, should have had infinite supply.The low difficulty makes this largely irrelevant, but still.--- Ritual ---Neat idea in theory, not at all workable in practice.This is a mini-game you can play before some fights. It's a dice game, the winner gets to apply a penalty on the opponent.It has neat connections to the narrative (and is used with a great intent in one area of the game), so I would have loved for it to work.However - the benefits are rather subtle, it's not a very safe bet that you'll win the ritual, and it's very slow. Its most likely use would be in tough fights, but these are the ones whose opponents also have correspondingly better ritual \"abilities\", and the ones you may have to retry a few times. Replaying the ritual in such situations seems to waste more time than it aids you, not only may you end up with a penalty yourself, but it's a significant amount of extra time between retries.The result is that, from what I've read, most players (myself included), just decided not to use the Ritual at all, after the first couple of hours, once the novelty has worn off.So it is one more system that becomes irrelevant. Again, neat idea in theory, but didn't quite work.--- Writing and Story ---I'm a huge fan of Jonas Kyratzes (although I have not played the Talos Principle yet; my familiarity is mostly through his own indie games, and ACE Team collaborations).In a way, he didn't disappoint - the dialogue is far better, ideas are expressed beautifully, and often very funny.Unfortunately, the themes end up being largely similar to those of previous games. It's a full new game that doesn't really add much to the world of Zenozoik. It kind of moves in place. This sense was very disappointing.I must give credit to three little sections:- I loved the monologue of Word; not just how it related to the previous games and the role of his character, but also for the idea it made much clearer, to me, about the relation between anarchy, anarchism, and historical memory.- There was also a subtle line about the \"mythology of when the stars changed\"; this only makes sense for those who've played Zeno Clash 2, I think, but it plays brilliantly with the last point of historical memory.- The ending was great, especially in the role and kind of love between Pseudo and the Boy. I am one to care not at all for plots and resolutions, in most games (they are usually vehicles for themes and ideas and not as important in themselves, in my mind), but I must say that it was both unexpected and significant to the ideas of power, control, and, of course, love.--- Conclusion ---All in all, a huge improvement over the previous games, and a very enjoyable game.Design-wise, it is far from water-tight, but nothing that hurts it too much, at least for one playthrough.It adds little to the previous games in the series, in terms of story, but it does a much better job of addressing the same themes.I'd expect it to be a great entry for beginners to the series (a lot less janky), and I'm sure it will be enjoyable to veterans, even if it ends up disappointing the expectations set at the end of ZC2.",

        "text": "Far better than Project Warlock (only played the first). Plays a bit like a zombie shooter more than a doom-like at times, with fodder enemies that slowly creep on you. Gets more hectic later on with shooter enemies.Weapons feel quite good, but I liked the upgrades, initially - where each weapon has 2 paths. Unfortunately, those 2 paths are very shallow (1/2 upgrades at most), and the character/upgrade progression doesn't keep up with the levels. You get many points early on (more than you need), as well as weapons. By the third act, you already have most of the weapons and upgrades, and it becomes quite a slog.My playthrough was interrupted by a trip midway through act 3 (of 4), and while it is an okay game, I don't really feel like picking it back up (especially as later levels are longer, enemies tankier and there isn't much more to explore, upgrade-wise).Still feel like it would be better to limit the loadout and offer a deeper upgrade tree. More focus on customization/experimentation rather than raw power.",

        "text": "Really excellent game. It's a combination of TIMEframe, Zelda, with a dash of The Witness.It didn't \"grab me\" as much as I would have liked, nor was it as life changing as many of the reviewers seem to regard it, but it's one of the most original games in how it seamlessly blends visuals, physics and planet transitions. It's a unique experience, that's for sure, and one that has basically no \"grind\". There's no progress at all, no unlocking doors, or getting items, or anything. The whole progress is in your understanding of how this solar system works, how the planets change, and where the paths are.It can be a bit frustrating and slow, especially at the beginning. Everything feels like it doesn't pay off, as you uncover another tiny part of the mystery without being sure about anything.I also found the endings rather underwhelming.But the journey is really great. It's the right kind of demanding. It's not a \"comfort\" game that you'll play to get a dopamine hit when beating up enemies or finding better equipment and the like. You really need to think and experiment and be patient to piece it all together. But it's really cool to think back, after figuring it all out. How much you've learned.The themes are all up my alley, but I didn't feel particularly moved by them. I definitely think there could be more to the endings (and there was certainly room for that; some unpursued paths suggested by the writing). Still, I'd heartily recommend it to anyone. Just know it is rather slow and demanding, requires a certain mindset to enjoy. But it's incredibly unique and also *good*.",

        "text": "The answer has to be \"Meh\". Although the review is largely negative, I'm still \"recommending\" it. Why? Because the boss battles, which are clearly the meat of the game, are actually quite alright. And the rest, while very flawed, is tolerable.The game is basically a boss-rush, with some contrived metroidvania-like structure to close off areas of the map until you find a specific boss to get its upgrade.The problem is that the map is basically a whole lot of empty space, with the occasional camouflaged trap that kills you and forces you to swim again for several seconds - across space that is so empty and tedious that by the time you reach the trap, you've forgotten about it and die again.There are some secrets here and there, but this comes down to a handful of fake walls (have fun walking into every wall), or upgrades behind an \"upgrade barrier\". Unfortunately, the map sucks. You can see the room completely once you enter it, but you can't mark areas where you've seen an upgrade, where you've seen a closed path, etc.; so expect unnecessary backtracking over long expanses of nothingness if you want to go back for an upgrade or need to find a previously blocked path.The bosses themselves are actually quite cool. While my first impression of every single boss was one of frustration (out of some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 pattern, awkward knockback and hitboxes, etc.), they all ended with a sense of satisfaction - because while the game communicates information very poorly, each boss has its own \"trick\". Once you figure it out, bosses become very doable, though still requiring some concentration. So this is good. Not perfect, but still good. Finally, the art is not very good. Some of it is fine, but they seemed to care little for pixel consistency (some things have huge pixels, others small pixels), and above all, it does an absolutely terrible job of communication what is foreground, background, what hurts you and what doesn't, etc.; In one instance, I was completely lost because the door opening mechanism completely blended into the background, while there was a barrier nearby - so I assumed the door would be opened after getting the upgrade to get through the barrier; NOPE, the barrier was a complete red flag - once I noticed the mechanism, got the upgrade, I destroyed the barrier only to find out it was nothing at all. Brilliant.The story isn't anything to write home about. Well, I say \"story\", but really, there's only a bit of world building which you find through scattered logs. But again, nothing particularly deep, original, or interesting.Anyway.If you want a boss rush game with very very mild trapping of a metroidvania, give it a shot.But expect poor visual communication and some frustration with the bosses, on first encounter.",

The art was very well picked - the weirdness almost writes itself into the game when you look at those wild 1500s paintings.

        "text": "Very cool little game.Basically, your characters start with a base level of stats, and you choose one event each week to build up specific stats (the stats are not randomized, but you only learn them by \"trial and error\"/cataloguing yourself (or using a guide, I suppose)).Beyond the base stats, you also get a randomized event specific to the section you've chosen.Most of these events involve choices and stat checks, which further increase or reduce some stats. Some events are special in that they have continuity in the following weeks. These can also make some sections of the town unusable.All in all, you have 6 weeks, meaning 6 choices per character.At the end of the game, you the town is destroyed and it's time to rebuild. Your last decision is to pick the role of each character (leader, builder, smelter, etc.). How successful your character is in the role depends on the stats. You are never explicitly told which stats matter, or the specific number required, all you get is how well you've done in the role, although some of the descriptions give you a strong hint as to which stat succeeded/failed.All in all, very simple,but also very enjoyable for a handful of plays. Early runs may take 40 minutes, since you read everything carefully (and, if like me, write things down). Later ones take 20 or 15 minutes, once you know what to do.The replayability comes from trying out the different roles, and character endings. These latter are determined by the sections/actions you've done throughout the 6 weeks, as well as special events.The game itself, as a piece of software, is terrible. Single fixed resolution, no options at all, no mouse controls, etc., everything is extremely basic (you get a picture and some text for each action); but it gets the job done.Really, the only thing missing is achievements, which would make it more appealing to hunt for all the endings. Especially since achievements would be a hint for which endings you're missing (the game tells you nothing whatsoever).The artstyle is really really cool, and the music is also pleasant and fitting, if minimal (there are 3 or 4 tracks, matching the mood of the week).The writing is also good, though not life changing. It's flavourful, sometimes funny, but that's it. At least for me, there was nothing to stick in my mind or mull over the next few days, weeks, etc.;Overall, it's a great framework for randomized story-telling, and would be right at home in a rogue-lite (FTL did something similar). The repeating events add welcome spice, and it's satisfying to try and fail, since you'll know next time which stats to raise to match the event's requirements. I do, however, think it's a bit insufficient for a full game. It's a very cool experiment, but don't expect to get more than an hour or two out of it.If you know what to expect, give it a shot. It's short and sweet.",

        "text": "The game is amazing, honestly.The visual effects are phenomenal, really a joy to look at, and I really like how the characters look - they've used real humans models this time around, warts and all. And yet it makes the characters feel much more real and attractive, somehow.The combat is obviously the focus. There are plenty of enemies with distinct patterns, but the most impressive aspect is the moveset. The new character, V, isn't that great, but Dante alone has enough weapons and moves to fill three or four campaigns. This is not a game you want to just play once for the campaign and be done with it. In fact, just going through Devil Hunter once, I would often forget a bunch of the moves with all the character switching, and you also get new weapons in the final 2 or 3 missions, which are completely unused. Couple that with the style ranking for each level, the game is clearly designed for multiple playthroughs, but in a good way. Only complaint is that, the scenes get a bit monotonous and the general vibe lost a lot of its darkness. I mean, Nero's theme song is pure pop. Dante is the only one who keeps that industrial metal vibe I loved from previous games. Honestly, it seems to take more cues from the DmC reboot that the original games.Still, it's not bad, just a bit different, unfortunately straying away from one of my favourite aspects of the series.Devil Hunter mode, I found, was still challenging (at least if you limit your uses of revives, which I did, to one), which is good. It forced you to find the best moveset against specific bosses or enemy encounters. The last few bosses, especially, required me to retry quite a few times, and to polish my play style. That's the right kind of challenge, to me - forcing the player to learn the tools he's given.If you like spectacle fighters for their gameplay, you really can't go wrong with this. Excellent combat and a treat to the eyes.P.S.: This is the kind of story I find entirely meaningless - strong dude fights big demon; big demon too strong, so they stall for a couple of missions to gain power; big demon is destroyed and bigger demon appears; then you're all family so wow.That said, it was still very well executed with great dramatic scenes, twists and general structure. And the focus on William Blake was also very welcome!",

        "text": "I was going to leave a barely positive review; however, in the last 15-30 minutes of the game, it became completely unplayable. The performance tanked into the maybe 10 fps, and nothing helped. Tried putting all graphical settings on lowest, even tried lowering the resolution to 720p, nothing changed. The game was unplayable. I actually tried to get into the next scene, but nothing changed. Much smaller scene with no effect and fewer objects, performance was still at 10 fps. Clearly a bug of some kind. Hence the negative review. The game is basically a walking simulator. It has some gunplay, but most of it extremely mild, and the game is really structured like a walking simulator, not a FPS.Guns sound really good, but the gunplay is pretty bad - only noticeable on the one section of the game that actually challenges you (spoiler: and which turned out to be infinitely spawning enemies and whose solution was to simply bypass the enemies and get to the elevator). The game excells in its architecture (both in buildings and in landscape) and is beautiful to behold. Style is reminiscent of Half-Life 2.The story is intriguing, but very sparse. It could be told in a couple of pages of text. There are very few notes spread around the world to flesh it out - too few, in my opinion.There is also a sequence that is clearly about Borges' Library of Babel. Ironically, where Borges wrote very dense short stories where everything had a purpose, this game is a short story where most things are filler.There seems to be a lot more backstory to the game than meets the eye (if you read the forums and guides, in particular), but most of these clues are buried so deep as to be almost entirely irrelevant to the game's core experience.Instead, what you get is a bland game interspersed with avant-guard sections with the simple and common message of the dangers of technology, which might be one of the most fashionable ideas in these days of AI.The biggest problem, to me, is that there is really very little to the game. Most levels have a bunch of extra rooms and dead-ends containing nothing but ammo. Even playing on Hardcore mode, my ammo capacity was maxed out most of the time. The game made ammo scarce by limiting your carrying capacity, not the amount actually found in the world. So most of the level \"design\" seemed to be explicit padding. There was no environmental story-telling, no extra notes fleshing out the world, nothing.There were a couple of puzzles which contributed nothing. In fact, they are not \"puzzles\", but random \"lever pulling\". Most of them, I solved having no idea whatsoever what I was doing, or that I had to do something. It was just clear from what the game offered (a lever here, and faucet there, etc.) that you had to do some things in sequence. Only after completing it would I find the reason why I had done it. They have no real logic of build-up behind them, they are just arbitrary gamey sections.The story was mildly intriguing, with a very cool setting, but, because of the above, feels extremely underwhelming. Voice-acting is actually top notch. I recently played Conarium - while a much better (though not great) game, its voice-acting was pretty terrible. Not here. Only two characters, but they're greatly acted.The sound design, in general, was very good. Some things ended awkwardly and abruptly but, for the most part, you can see that they played close attention to the sound design and what little music exists comes in in great places, used with surgical precision.On the whole, the game is both short and padded. Pick one or the other. As it stands, it is beautiful, but offers no other reason for your to play it.It could be justified by the scenery and maybe the story, but given the performance problems that prevented me to finish the game, I'd pass.",

        "text": "Very uninspired.The magic system is pointless to the extreme.The upgrade system gives you a choice between two upgrades per weapon, but they're just there and don't really make for a specific playstyle.The weapon switching controls are among the worse I've seen, to the point of being unusable. They force you to bind 2 weapons to the same key because they share ammo type. But you can't actually disable one if you don't like it, and don't ask me which one is chosen when you try. Sometimes seems the first weapon, sometimes the weapon. Not to mention the weapons have a \"cooldown animation\" which doesn't show when you switch weapon, which is a mild but accumulating annoyance. Key rebinds don't allow you to remove a key, nor do they allow multiple rebinds, so it's very fun to try.Also, for some reason, the mouse scrolling to change weapon doesn't change on first scroll. I don't know how many scrolls it takes because, yet again, the game isn't consistent about it.The weapons are okay, though very unbalanced. Mostly, it seems like the first thing that came to the dev's mind when he sat down to design the weapons. But hey, they go boom in a satisfying way (well, some of them; the crossbow, which should have been one of the most fun weapons (remember the harpoon gun in Bioshock?) is really disappointing).The levels are also rather confusing and lack direction. Most of the time, I finished levels by mistake, just by going whatever path was in front of me. Most levels are 2 minutes or something like that, so forget any kind of build up. The most used trick in the game is to spawn enemies behind you when you press a switch or pick up a key, or spawn them in areas you've cleared before.Most secrets are about spamming spacebar near walls.All this said, the game is otherwise cool!I really liked the fact that each set of levels have completely different enemies and visuals.I also like its gritty style, although it lacks a bit of polish.Unfortunately, the game also induces massive motion sickness in me. So, even if I thought this was a good game, I wouldn't play it.All in all, the game is just mediocre in most things. But it can get you a fix for an old-school shooter if you need one.Nothing worth going out of your way to play, in my view, but nothing you need to avoid like the plague.",

        "text": "This is one of the most frustrating and unsatisfying games I've played in a long time.It is also one of the most interesting, and the kind of thing I want to encourage. Hence the \"positive recommendation\".The whole game is a conversation between you and an alien computer. You slowly piece together the alien language structure (after a short guided tutorial to get you started), mostly by asking questions related to the answers you get, thus uncovering what happened on the planet and to its \"people\".Neither the language nor the writing system exist which makes it fascinating (although, mild spoiler, they are both based on Chinese, so it your experience may be very different if you are familiar with their language and writing).Unfortunately, the way the game works in by having an extremely stupid parser. You must input an exactly correct sentence for it to work. I mean, imagine being new to english and asking \"how many money is this?\" on the grocery store, and getting no answer at all because you didn't ask \"how much\". That's my experience with the game. A tiny mistake will result in no useful feedback at all. Worst, sometimes you may ask grammatically correct sentences, but in a way the game didn't account for, or about a subject that isn't part of the plot, per se.Both cases result in no useful feedback. Which means you don't even know if you only need to rephrase the question, or if it's a dead end.The lack of feedback basically killed the game, for me.Even following a guide, things just didn't work, most of the time. For example, sometimes you need to ask \"why\" after getting a specific answer. But asking \"Why is X\" (X being a reformulation of that answer) doesn't work. So order and context matter. But none of these things relate to language - they are just limitations of a stupid parser.So, ultimately, I felt like the game just didn't work. The design is simply not there. Too little feedback, too narrow in what it recognizes as a useful question or comment.Some people have had more success than me, judging by the reviews. I don't know.I still love what it's trying to do, and I may try it again in some months with a fresher mindset. I wanted to love it, but it just didn't work, for me.A similar, but perhaps more \"mathy\" example of this is \"Machine at the Heart of the World\" (you can get it here: https://evidentlycube.itch.io/machine-at-the-heart-of-the-world). It, too, is about learning the rules, but it is more linear (if more complicated, in a way), but it is also much clearer as to when you actually learn a new rule. The feedback is clear, which is crucial.Anyway. I'd love to see this idea taken up in a different way (perhaps with more conversational options for more learning opportunities, or a more flexible parser, or an AI companion able to give hints, reformulations, suggest ideas, etc.; better feedback and ways to get unstuck).

        "text": "This is an adventure game done right!None of the whole arbitrary item combinations or pixel hunting, while still preserving the narrative core of the old school point n' click games.The dialogue is really well made, with timed responses as the \"default\", creating a fairly natural conversational flow (although sometimes replies fade too quickly, feeling like you need to interrupt another character to get your reply in time).The main mechanic of the game is the use of a radio, dialling to various frequencies to find messages at specific zones of the game or acting on the world. The game is very much a supernatural mystery, which is cool throughout, as you're trying to slowly piece things together. Unfortunately, the ending, to me, was very unsatisfying in this regard. Many things aren't really explained or make sense (things make sense in order to understand the story, for the most part, but the supernatural part is never explained and feels like it was conjured out of nothing just to tell this particular story).The story has themes, which is good, but they didn't do much, for me.It's hard to get deeper into it without spoiling everything, so I'll end it here. It's a good game. It's a different way to design an adventure game, and one that I think worked really well, especially with the dialogue innovations (which may have come from the Telltale's games, which I haven't played, so I can't comment on it, other than that at least one of two founders of this studio came from Telltale).There are a bunch of different endings, influenced by a few limited choices you can make throughout. I didn't really feel compelled to go for them, but that's only because I didn't care much about the story or its themes. Here, of course, your mileage may vary.  ",

        "text": "This is extremely hard to recommend.They've nailed the aesthetic, but the game is a complete mess.Both the visuals and the audio are great, especially the effects that you only see when moving and interacting.The problem with the gameplay is that (1) it's extremely confusing (to the point that you will not know if the game is working when you open it up); (2) it's extremely slow and (3) it isn't well tuned at all.The game is a \"falling simulator\". You don't walk around, you fall. You can very very slowly move around to get out of the way of obstacles - if you can predict 40 seconds in advance. If you think walking simulators are slow, think again, and maybe stay clear of this game.The main mechanic, aside from slowly dodging, is \"phasing\". It's a mode that lasts maybe 10 seconds, during which you can collide with enemies without death. It also takes 30 seconds to reset its cooldown.The game is also dark 90% of the time. Every 10 seconds, you get a 1 second where things light up. You must use that to predict where you need to go and if any enemy will be there so you can use phase at the right moment.The problem is that, being 90% in the dark, you can't observe enemies very well do understand their behaviour.The lack of tuning is perhaps fortunate, because you can just get lucky and stumble upon a path that has no enemies near you. That's a blessing, because death, given the low speed, is just annoying.But then, for example, I didn't die nor understand the enemies in level 8 (out of 9). It seemed like I just fell for 5 minutes without any danger at all. Was it luck? Design? Who knows.It certainly succeeds in making you feel completely helpless. In a way, it fits, aesthetically. But it's not good helplessness. As a player, it was mostly confusion.That said, it doesn't really overstay its welcome, and it's really cool, graphically. To be honest, I was ready to give it a negative review until maybe 75% of the way through. Then I guess I accepted the game for what it was and recognized where it does succeed.It's an oddball either way. You can get it cheap, so feel free to try it out. Just don't expect anything particularly satisfying or life-changing. Great visuals, great audio, unsatisfying design, overall underwhelming.",

        "text": "The game is very good, but also very easy to play \"incorrectly\", as I believe I did.What I mean is this - I try to play as \"Ghost\" and \"Non-lethally\". This time, I went further and tried not to use violence at all, if possible, meaning no knock-downs.When you do this, the game becomes over-reliant on QuickSave/Load, as the targets' visibility isn't very clear (and seems in fact inconsistent; on early levels, standing on a cupboard in front of a character was fine; in the last mission, standing 20 meters below a character or behind a staircase would get you detected) and it's far too easy to make mistakes.Most of the game's tools and mechanics are also not very useful in stealth runs (if by stealth you mean actual stealth, without bodies detected, and so on).This is made far worse when you try to \"explore\" the story as well, by collecting the notes and books and explore every area.So yeah, I think I played the game \"wrong\". Actual stealth is not a very good choice for a first playthrough (if at all). Another problem I've had is that, like Dishonored 2, the areas are very large and open, but not very \"explorable\". They don't seem to have a \"natural path\" to explore them, so you can spent 20 or 30 minutes just aimlessly going around collecting bits and things without anything making sense. Really, you need to go through the main objective and the optional contracts before it starts clicking together - which is fine, but again, not how I prefer to play, relying on self-driven exploration.This is probably not a good review, but it may help those whose styles are similar to mine.If I could go back in time, I'd probably let go of any \"ethical roleplaying\" and just embrace the game's violence. Enjoy the various tools and mechanics and just enjoy the game as it presents itself.Then perhaps a second playthrough could have provided better, more focused, gameplay without worrying about the pointless collectables (I mean, the last level had 27 bonecharms and god knows how many bone fragments, and I don't think a single one was particularly helpful for my style of playing) and having a better idea of what to expect of enemy paths and visibility.Either way, I don't even think the game can really be enjoyed in a single playthrough. The levels are very dense in encounters and rooms with various ways to solve them, but feel like they can only be enjoyed once you try to play *with* them in different ways.So yeah. Embrace the chaos, go berserk. I'm sure you'll have a much better time than I did - and the game deserves it for it excels in its music and architecture and worldbuilding (even though I wasn't very fond of the plot or storyline; the society is just as ruined by corruption and the \"inquisition\" under the \"legitimate\" empress as it was before and this is never really acknowledged; but I love the folk horror element of the world and the working class focus.",

        "text": "It's a really neat game. It looks amazing, and despite the minimalism, it manages to convey a lot. The sound design is also top notch.It immediately reminded me of Mu Cartographer and Capsule, although this one is far more narratively driven.The game is very mysterious, and and first hour or two are great as a result. Unfortunately, the story is rather slow to unfold, and many points fail to develop properly and ends up rather unsatisfying.It's also a very impressive feat, creatively. There is a whole ecossystem of a maybe 10 to 20 organisms described and drawn out. As much as I love this, however, their existence is 90% flavour text, and it's presented through rather dry log entries.I stress it again, it's very impressive, but it's such a failure of communication, in my opinion. Most people (myself included) wouldn't read a dry description of insects or fungi or what have you - so why would we want to do so about an imaginary ecossystem? Life is often stranger than fiction, too.So this seems like kind of a wasted effort. Commendable, but ultimately feels like it was a rather \"selfish\" creation; it doesn't do much for the player other than maybe show off the writer's imagination (and research).Finally, the gameplay was also very underwhelming, especially in respect to the ecossystem.Early on, there were elements of Waking Mars - where you were collecting samples which you could deploy in the world to interact with other creatures (to inhibit growth and clear a path; to catalyze growth to block a current). Unfortunately, these were completely ditched and never developed later. This would have helped, I think, in making the flavour text feel more relevant and interesting. Perhaps it could contain hints about where and how to use different elements, etc., to solve real problems.I tend to find pure flavour text tedious and irrelevant; it's a very different matter when the text is tied to my *actions* as a player.There is also some resource management but, once again, very very minimal and almost irrelevant. You can use samples to replenish oxygen or power, which you need more of one or the other depending on the area. But you almost always get whatever samples you need in the current area you're exploring, so you don't need to map or catalogue anything.Worse, the game encourages you to collect and bring back new samples to the base, but these occupy precious inventory space - and the movement is rather tedious, so going back to the base is a hassle.So yeah.I still enjoyed the game quite a bit. The story's payoff was a bit disappointing, but it still kept me interested throughout, so it was cool. Visual design is really excellent, and so is the audio. Writing seems very competent, but also far too wasteful and ultimately dull. Game design is also very basic, although it hints at more (which makes it feels more unsatisfying than if it hadn't been there in the first place!).Also, I used to love these kinds of quirky games, and somehow touch with them over the years. This game reminds me where my attention to should go again!",

        "text": "It's a neat attempt at a game. If you like Philip K. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, you may enjoying it. It has many little references to his work and his life, and obviously the whole theme about shifting realities.The game mechanics themselves, though, and don't have much interesting - thematically or otherwise. There is a tenuous connection to what (and which) reality is, but that's about it.Unfortunately, the game is quite buggy, sometimes fatally - the first time I booted the game, the mouse kept moving to the left. At the end of chapter 3, it failed to spawn the final puzzle, and when I tried to restart, it restarted the whole scene. I didn't feel like redoing it, so it is good bye to Californium.I have also managed to get out of bounds a couple of times (fortunately with no consequences, but I can imagine you getting stuck permanently).Worse, the game makes me extremely sick. Not sure if the colors or the movement, but I feel great discomfort when playing it and it persists for a while after, so yeah.Mechanically, you're just going around looking for \"sigils\". These are little symbols of light that may only appear when you're moving, or when you look at some objects in a certain order, or when you look through another object, etc.; that's it. It's a hidden object game.It gets annoying because you need to find every single on to progress. You just walk around looking for things popping or blinking or whatever, with short bits of dialogue in between. Maybe if the game wasn't buggy and nauseating I could have given it a mild recommendation. As is, I don't.Important note: I've been reading \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and I am not a big fan. I appreciate some of it, but it doesn't move me; the game doesn't seem to do much with his themes, though. This was interesting, this was not - it's mostly referential. But perhaps people who *really* enjoy and \"get\" \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 may get more out of the game than I did.",

        "text": "The game isn't completely terrible, it is reasonably competent (i.e. not a buggy mess).That said, the game design is entirely uninspired and the game comes from an entirely different era of 3D combat - it's hard to appreciate how good an innovation the whole Arkham/AC contextual combat really was, focusing on countering; here, you simply have barely readable animations, which often transition into vulnerability states, where enemies become invulnerable and stun lock you in the middle of your own combo.The level design is best exemplified by the very first mission: \"follow the gold arrow in the radar for your main objective\";the second mission \"follow the blue arrow for your secondary objective\"; and the reward for exploration - you go out of the way to find a chest at the end of a meandering \"corridor\" - \"you found 100 XP\".That's about it. The level design is uninspired at this level. Optional objectives aren't anything related to the character or the mission, really, they are about follow the blue marker, and an excuse will be found later.There are a bunch of chests throughout the otherwise very linear levels, but nothing interesting.There are some texts you can collect (sometimes in chests, sometimes elsewhere) which are quite cool! I am not sure whether they are entirely fictional or not, but they seem at least inspired by real documents or historical facts. These give a very welcome flavour to the game.I decided not to continue playing it, though. The gameplay is simply not good, and the game doesn't really offer anything. It doesn't do anything particularly well; coupled with how dated it is, there is no reason to play this, so I'll move on.That said, I am now curious to try the first Assassin's Creed again.",

They also like to pull the rug from under your feet and introduce a completely random change to the rules of the level halfway through. Levels are often very easy once you know what to expect, but not when you're first screwed over.May be your thing, but not mine. I am simply not enjoying it at all, so I'll move on.",

        "text": "I've been recently getting into these weird lo-fi horror-ish games that try, in some ways, to emulate PSX era graphics (with affine texture mapping and vertex value rounding). I think it's a really cool niche genre, although the bulk of the games made seem to come from small game jams.Since this was one was on Steam, I thought it would be a more refined outcome of that niche.Well, it isn't.First off, the game seems to be a more developed version of one (and a half) games by Leakyfingers (check out his \"SEASHELLS\" game, although also a bit of \"Trying To Sing In Static\", they're both free on itch.io).I don't just mean stylistically, although there's a lot of overlap, but also in themes and structure.\"No one lives under the lighthouse\" certain has more stuff in it. The island is larger, there are more items, more steps, more areas at the end, and so on. But there is practically no development in themes or meaning.The style is a bit awkward, at times, but is generally pretty good.The biggest problem, to me, is that the game has lots of optional stuff, for achievements, but it is never clear what actions are optional and which advance the storyline. There are also some completely illogical sequences where you must get item X before you do action Y (in the optional stuff), even though the two are completely unrelated.The game also has quite a lot of padding in it - which, to be fair, so do Leakyfingers' games... And I don't get it. Sure, people care about time for money, but most of these games, if nothing else, triump in \"density\". There is generally not much to them, but most of what they do contributes to the overall point; SEPTEMBER1999 on steam is a great example of this, I think. It's a 5 minute game, but none of those 5 minutes are wasted.Here, it's quite the contrary. The game is stretched to 2+ hours, but the content could easily fit in 1 hour or maybe less, really.The ending, especially, was extremely awkward and long winded. They just really hammered the answer to the mystery over and over again. I don't get why, it carried nothing new.I don't know. It's not a terrible game, but it was a disappointment, to me, perhaps because I was familiar with the style already. I expected it to do something more with the raw material of itch.io games, but it really just stretched the same experience for longer playtime. ",

        "text": "P.S.: Elizabeth says something to the effect of \"The great thing about Rapture is all of the new books to read\". I feel the need to say that this is an absolute LIE (cf. my reviews of the first and second Bioshock games).I will have to admit, however, that Burial at Sea did receive an influx of (5) new books, with such refined titles as \"The Farmer's Girl - Ready to Get Down and Dirty\" and \"Co-Eds - It's Never Too Late for an Education\". The pinnacle literature. ___This is certainly better than the first episode, but still not great.The gameplay is okay, although it's completely at odds with the whole exploration aspect of the game. It's a stealth game, and you can easily die - which complete resets your progress since the last checkpoint. Checkpoints are quite far apart, though, especially early on, where areas are open. This creates a huge penalty for exploration. I really disliked the beginning as a result.It's not a brilliant stealth game, but it is quite nice once you have a few more weapons and plasmids to get the ball rolling. Early on, it's terrible.I also find the levels to be quite confusing and labyrinthic. They were \"open\" but lacked direction and it was difficult to know where you were supposed to go, or when, especially with the number of closed doors that were opened at some arbitrary point in the future.So yeah. Gameplay wise, I didn't really enjoy it.Story-wise, I'm torn. The vast majority of it is more or less like episode 1. It's an inward looking story that is just about connecting Infinite with Rapture. Nothing meaningful or relevant in any way.The ending, however, hit hard. I obviously won't spoil it, but there was big twist. The setup was brilliant, I've got to say. All the threads set up in episode 1 and throughout episode 2 suddenly connected at the end. It's just narrative gymnastics - it's still meaningless, but very well made.The twist had a second part, however, that was more beautiful. I'll leave it at that. I didn't enjoy playing through it a whole lot, and dislike how the story is mostly about connecting two settings without adding much to either. But the ending was very impactful and had its share of grace, so I'll leave it as a positive recommendation.",

        "text": "This was a disappointment. I guess one shouldn't expect much in a 3 hour-long DLC, but still...Yeah, it was great to visit Rapture in its prime. That was the first hour of the DLC, if you take time to look around and listen to the people's short conversations. The rest of the game throws into a Fontaine Industries after his \"fall\", which means it's goold old rapture where everything is falling apart and there are mad people everywhere.There isn't much of a plot, honestly. The backstory (through the audiologs) is essentially just \"Columbia stuff is happening in rapture, people see tears\" but that's about it. The actual plot is just a variation on Infinite's theme, but it doesn't add anything, really.Gameplay-wise, the game is much harder, but it doesn't feel very good. Somehow, the gunplay is worse than in the main game. The combat is much harder, there is barely any ammo around (nor do your weapons carry anything) and the penalty for death is much, much higher, you lost more than half of your money (at least in Hard mode). This means that the game is much more punishing and bad players get no upgrades, while good players should get enough money to buy them. Doesn't seem great design, to me, but it's only 3 hours long and you don't *need* the upgrades, anyway.I don't know. Maybe if the game was longer there would be more room for the gameplay to be better. I liked the fact that it was harder, but it felt too constrained, given the lack of ammo and eve and how much damage the enemies did.The writing was the biggest disappointment. It was little more than \"hey, you remember Rapture, right?\". Doesn't add anything. So yeah. It's great to look around during the first hour, but not much value after that point.",

        "text": "This is a weird one.First of all, there are many good innovations as a Bioshock game. The gameplay is even more polished (though also more streamlined) from 2, continuing the trend from 1. The weapons felt great, though the end of the game was rather annoying with the limited weapon and ammo count. For most of the game, you'll have more than you need, but later on it seems like there's no ammo anywhere, and enemies only drop the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 weapons. It's also a bit disappointing that there aren't multiple ammo types per weapon. This is in most respects a much more simplified version of previous Bioshocks (which was already a much simplified version of System Shock). In some ways this is bad, but the game feels good to play and the focus in clearly the narrative, so I'm okay with it, overall. The plot is a cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 but I don't care much about it. The end of Part 2 was very well implemented, though. The game ups the stakes and you really feel like you're in the middle of world changing events. Everything from the visuals to the sounds reinforces this feeling (two of the most powerful examples were the skies turning red in the opening scene, and the bagpipes (which sounded more like an accordeon lol) at the end of Part 2).One interesting aspect is how the audiologs (and the kinescopes) now tell you not exclusively about the backstory of Columbia (as they did in Rapture), but they're actually in the \"present tense\" and react to your actions and the plot (not \"choices\" (there aren't many) but plot actions nonetheless).This was different, but cool.The game's pacing also seems much better in multiple levels. Not only do specific \"areas\" feel better, with more distinctive parts of combat, exploration and exposition, but the game's plot is also more structured with very different themes in each (of the 3 parts).I also liked this, I feel like it was an improvement over previous games.So the game is really good. That said, it starts like a Bioshock game in Part 1, and turns into something else entirely in Part 3. And this something else is a lot less interesting (to me, anyway) than the previous games.Sure, innovation is good, but they went too overboard with it. Plus I found the multiple-dimensional and time travel quite loose, to the point where any plotline, no matter how ludicrous, would have felt \"plausible\". It's not science fiction in clearly defining the rules of the world and then exploring them; instead, there are no rules and anything can happen.But I'm someone who cares a lot more about the world than the plot, so this is the point of contention, for me. The world was interesting, in a similar way to Rapture (though a variation on the theme, for sure). Part 1 (Slate etc.) fit the pattern. Part 2 (Fink etc.) started okay but started showing the chaos, and Part 3 (Elizabeth, Comstock, etc.) just throw everything out the window. I \"got\" most of the plot points, but I just didn't care about them. There's little substance there, in my eyes.So yeah. If you want Bioshock, you'll probably better off looking elsewhere (or just playing the first half of the game). It's a very good game regardless, but it went too off the rails at the end, storywise, to feel satisfying (to me, anyway).Oh yeah, I should also add that the Luteces are brilliant characters. Their scenes are really funny, often with subtle details. Big thumps up for whoever was responsible for those 2 ([spoilers]or those 1[/spoilers]).I'm curious to see which direction Burial at Sea takes. ",

        "text": "I regret to inform that, despite the 8 years spent between the events of Bioshock and Bioshock 2, and the influx of outsiders into Rapture, its inhabitants were still subjected to the same 4 books as in the first game, with one prophetic exception.The four books were \"Evolutionary Biology\", \"Applied Genetics\", \"Practical Eugenics\" and \"Dawkin's Law\". You will note that the aforementioned books existed in hundreds of copies, from medical quarters to painting rooms. Every citizen must have been an expert (or very avid amateur) on the then new science of genetics.The prophetic addition was written the game's main antagonist, Doctor Lamb, and is called \"Unity and Metamorphosis\".____Well, okay, about the game, though. First off, the game crashed maybe 5 or 6 times, for me. I decided to play the Remastered edition because I remember having had crashes with the original; this doesn't appear to fix them, unfortunately.The game does look very good, though. A huge upgrade compared to Bioshock 1 (without the remaster).Bioshock 2 is a huge step up in terms of gameplay and visuals. The art is much more fleshed out, not just in terms of visual fidelity, but in artistic quality and quantity, too. Places are more varied and look much more striking than the original (which already looked great!). These alone are probably reasons for you to play this.The plot is irrelevant to me, as is the first game's. It's just an excuse to keep the player moving forward.The back story, though, I found quite good. It focused a bit too much on the main antagonist, Lamb; I really liked her character, but it was well established in the first third of the game or so, and the rest was mainly a reinforcement of the same ideas and themes. Not the most interesting in this respect, but still the main reason to play the game, in my opinion, perhaps after the sheer style of the game.The gameplay is simpler. The game is more linear (as you can't actually revisit areas) and the crafting system is gone. I actually don't mind either of them. I dislike how meaningless the crafting and alchemy were in The Witcher, because those systems were central to the character you were roleplaying - but Bioshock's crafting system didn't serve much of a purpose anyway, so I don't care that it's gone.The implementation is death is also quite poor - there's no penalty at all for dying when you're just right back to the closest Vita Chamber. Even when you carry a Little Sister, she materializes in front of the chamber, so yeah - no penalty at all.That said, the gunplay is so, so much better. I think the gameplay is definitely a step up.The music is also great, though there is less emphasis on the licensed music (unfortunately) and more on the eerie strings.Not sure whether I'd rank this above or below the first game. Obviously, this one plays more or less the same keys as the first game did, so you could see its derivativeness as a flaw. On their own, though, both stand up pretty well.Onward to Infinite, I suppose. ",

        "text": "In some ways great, in others not so much.The artstyle is nice and unique, but the writing is where the game shines. My contact with argentinian culture is very limited, but somehow a handful of Borges' later stories were enough to right at home with the game's characters and scenarios.It's funny and doesn't take itself serious, but it seems very genuine and argentinian to me.Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't quite up to the part. The general idea is okay, but the implementation is very lacking in three respects:(1) the extra mechanics (beyond going up and down in the rhythm) don't actually change your task, but add a lot of confusion to the screen - it often becomes unclear which way to go and when to go.(2) the gameplay constantly changes the music \"track\" it is following (the bass track, the accordion track, the guitar track, etc.) with no warning whatsoever and no period of habituation; worse, some of the instrumental ornaments go off the established rhythm - this is good for the music, but not for the gameplay.(3) the game is too short.Ony (3) requires some elaboration, especially in how it relates to (2). The game has 13 short tracks of around 2 minutes (some less, some more). Each of these tracks in a level.The trouble is, as I mentioned in (2), that the levels are often confusing. The length of the tracks makes it difficult to establish basic patterns and then build complexity on top of them. This results in the confusing track-switching that often took me out of the experience - none of that great feeling of \"getting in the zone\" which I so often get with rhythm games.The game is shorter than one hour (unless you want to replay the levels or go for challenges, which don't add too much to the game, imo) - but I feel like it could have been better to stretch it out a bit more, reuse tracks, and use this to establish patterns in earlier levels and then complicating them on later ones. Especially important to establish when the track changes will happen on the easier levels.This short discussion of gameplay doesn't \"solve\" the game, however, because I feel like the current structure serves the story perfectly! Overall, though, it isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been, especially as a rhythm game.The music was a bit hit or miss, to me. I was expecting older \"classic\" tango, but the band in the game is a bit more modern. I also found the patterns to be more or less unrelated to the tango's rhythms (with short exceptions).So yeah. Not a perfect game, and especially disappointing in its gameplay. But I loved the writing (this was a genuine surprise!) and I enjoyed the \"whole package\" as a nice little diversion which doesn't overstay its welcome.",

        "text": "Game is okay. Obviously, production value is very impressive (animations, models, the world, and the orc voice-acting is stellar); the gameplay, unfortunately, is Assassin's Creed, like most other games of the last decade, it seems (you climb towers to unlock map icons and then you walk to those icons and press whatever button the games tells you to collect a random piece of paraphernalia; some of the icons have missions where you kill things).The game's main feature is the Orc Nemesis, which gets an upgrade from the first game - this time you don't just defeat orcs but actually take over fortresses and maintain a 3-level hierarchy of orcs within each region.This is really the core of the game, despite all the accrued stuff.In one way, the system is really cool - in another, it isn't a game by itself and is only a heavy flavor on top of the more typical action game. Basically, you go around killing warchiefs, \"mini bosses\" which have their weaknesses and strengths. Ideally you will weaken them and convert them to your army, but you may want to kill them for loot.Some of these warchiefs require some foreplay before they appear (like poisoning 3 grog barrels, or killing 5 units in stealth, or whatever). Fortresses have an overlord, a \"final\" boss, and they have 3-5 warchiefs. Each warchief grants the fortress some kind of perk when you try to siege it (maybe the orcs will rain fire on you, or poison, or have beasts defending the fortress, etc.). Similarly, you can bring your own warchiefs to give you a siege perk.What is a siege? Basically, you and your army of orcs storm the fortress and need to stand in a sequence of \"points\" to capture them. These will be protected by warchiefs.Once you capture every point, you take on the overlord and his retinue more or less alone.Ok. All of this sounds good and can be more or less fun. Unfortunately, it is mostly a grind. You don't need to think anything through. You kill all the warchiefs before you attack the fortress (by doing their mission, which includes the foreplay and the confrontation) and then you can storm the fortress without any trouble.The whole thing is just going through the motions of pursuing and dominating every orc warchief, then capturing the fortress.Things don't really evolve while you're killing warchiefs (except, occasionally, an orc will become warchief when you kill the previous one), unless you die (which shouldn't happen too often once you've learned the mechanics). There are a bunch of extra missions to train your own warchiefs, or to use them to ambush enemies, or to rescue them if they're captured, or whatever. But these aren't really very fundamental. They all boil down to \"go to icon, kill big bad orc\". Your warchiefs have traits, but you don't really need to pay much attention to it. You gain coins by completing missions which you can use to make them stronger but, again, you don't need to pay much attention to it.The system is wider than it is deep. You can do many many things, but you don't *need* to do any of it.This would be a really cool strategy game, I think, if you had a tighter timer and had to choose which warchiefs to attack and when, who to train, and so on. But you don't. So you just do the same routine missions of killing and dominating bad orcs in every region; over and over again.My biggest problem is probably how meaningless the world becomes when the map is so central to the gameplay. I have no idea if the world's geography makes sense or was given any attention. It looks good, but you never need to use landmarks for navigation. You press the icon on the map, and then you follow the icon on your screen. The game is designed so that you don't need to pay *any* attention to the world, which is an incredible waste...I remember when something like Assassin's Creed and Infamous 2 had collectibles around the world that made you pay attention to the little architectural details and so on. These were partially defeated by the minimap icons (instead of looking at the architecture, you looked at the minimap).These days, the architecture is bypassed completely and the collectibles are a dead remnant of a cool system - they no longer serve the purpose of directing attention and are merely fuel for people's OCD.Oh well.If you *really* enjoy the loop, you can probably play this forever - since the sieging system has some online component. But you don't plan anything, really. You just grind. You diligently kill everything and that's about it. There are a bunch of different ways to kill things, but they're not very fundamental, in my opinion.Like the Witcher 3, it could be much more, but it ends up playing very safe and being all too familiar - which I guess is understandable given how much these games cost.The game is good, but don't expect to be surprised. P.S.: The extras, like the poems and the artifacts, while adding absolutely nothing in terms of gameplay (you go to icon on map , you press button, you move on) were very cool in terms of flavor. The artifacts were basically archaeology; the poems were in alliterative verse, which you rarely see nowadays, but which you'll encounter if you read Tolkien - since it was the default style in epic poetry like Beowulf and the Poetic Edda. It was unexpectedly true to Tolkien's style!.",

        "text": "I could describe Immortal Planet as the Souls' series stripped to its basics - except that I think the Souls' series can't really split apart without destroying what makes it great. The whole is better than the sum of its parts.But anyway. Immortal Planet is a very simple game that uses Souls-like bleak, sparse and cryptic lore and its slow and methodical combat reliant on stamina conservation and pattern-reading. The game isn't amazing, the animation are simple and have few frames, the RPG elements (weapons, stats, spells, etc.) isn't very deep, and so on.But the game is still very solid!In particular, it does a beautiful thing - it demands you to pay attention and actually learn how to play it. I found the game very difficult, at the beginning, but by the end of an area I could pretty much clear it without getting hit - not from levelling up a lot, but by learning the patterns. Knowing how to read the enemy's attack animations, when to parry, when to dodge, and so on.I can give a specific example of this. I lost my progress after 3 hours or so of playing. I had cleared a whole area and part of a second. It was frustrating that my save got wiped, but I decided to try again. I cleared both areas in less than an hour. I was relatively underlevelled, and yet it was much faster than the first time. Not many games do this, nowadays! (Think of Assassin's Creed of The Witcher, where the core of the game is about completing meaningless \"stuff\" marked on the map - restarting would take more or less the same time to recover progress).I think this is enough for my review. The game looks and sounds okay, the lore has some nice \"texture\", but I didn't pay too much attention to it. The combat has few elements, but its methodical nature more than makes up for it, since each element is used to a much deeper degree!The game isn't too difficult (although the beginning may suggest otherwise) but it does provide a good challenge. If you want a much much smaller scale Souls-like, give it a go. ",

        "text": "In some ways, this is a great game; in others, it is an extremely \"safe\" game that doesn't do anything new at all and simply conforms to terrible design practices.It is obviously a landmark in sheer scale, and the animation and voice acting are among the best I've seen (although I don't play many narrative-focused games, so maybe there are better examples out there) - smiles and kisses aside, which are still extremely awkward haha.They've also done an absolutely stellar job with the landscape and the sky. Especially the latter is a huge advancement over most other games, especially the previous ones in the series. The colors and the lit clouds look amazing - only criticism is that every day looks like either rapture or doomsday; it's a bit too dramatic, too much of a good thing.The game is essentially Assassins' Creed, minus the climbing, plus a few barebones RPG systems.There were 4 main disappointments I had with the game:(1) everything is routinized, plainly boring. The map has everything marked out and the writing isn't at all designed to let you play without the map - most quests don't give you good directions, and even the ones that do often don't store those directions on the quest log; plus, direction are often given with reference to some other place, but you can't ask for direction to that reference place, so it's hopeless.This systematization permeates the whole game and removes all local flavor, to me.Finding \"epic\" gear is just a question of buying a map from a shop and going to all of the marked points; either that or going to the generically marked points on the map (bandit camps, caves, buried or guarded treasure, etc.) and collecting whatever is at the marked point. Most of these points are revealed from the start, too, which is just terrible.\"Relic\" gear, which is orange (I guess it's the \"best\" gear available) is named, which was great the first time I found a cool-named and powerful sword - but then I realized they come repeated across tier levels, so you'll find the same sword at different levels, which removes the legendary element.(2) the quest design is pretty linear and quests self-contained; my favourite aspect of cRPGs like Fallout and NWN (expansions) was that the quests often interlocked with one another. They weren't just a bunch of isolated chores, but they were almost a \"cycle\" of apparently independent quests that eventually conflicted with one another, typically with cross-village conflicts and so on. How you resolved the conflict and which faction you ultimately aligned with was the soul of the games, to me. This game has very little of that.(3) playing the game is like fishing with a huge net, you cast down the nets and you catch every fish in the way - everything happens passively. No plan or anything, you just move forward and everything happens naturally. I mean this mostly in respect to quests and the RPG elements like gear and alchemy. The latter, especially.Alchemy was great in the first game, where each ingredient had a \"pseudo-chemical\" component, and recipes were about the way these components were put together, not specific ingredients. There were also secondary components that slightly altered the potion effect and so on. It could have been deeper, but it was a great start! Unfortunately, both sequels simplified the system and the result is extremely underwhelming in the third game.Ingredients are \"hard\", there are no components anymore. Worse, you only need to brew a potion once; then all you need is to meditate for the potion to replenish. There are also several tiers for each potion, for stronger effects, but the logic is the same. The recipes are found randomly through the world. As long and you do quests and loot everything in the way, you'll gather both ingredients and recipes. There's no agency there. I find this a really, really bad way of doing things.Let me put it this way - you're not pretending to be a witcher, you're pretending to be pretending to be a witcher. You don't actually deal with the details of being a witcher.Many quests are about following tracks and scents, which are just a matter of activating your witcher senses and following the red trail. The same happens with the various monsters. As long as you loot things and \"read\" (i.e. open) books, you'll collect all the information about monsters in your bestiary. These tell you which oil and bomb and sign to use against each monster. There's no focused information gathering from the player. As long as you loot everything and you do quests, everything is collected into your alchemy book, bomb book, oil book, etc. etc.; it's all stupidly simplified.I loved the potential of the first game, although I felt it didn't commit hard enough; the second was a step back, but I had high hopes for the third game, given the sheer scale. Turns out it was an ever bigger step backwards.(4) the game is too easy; I played on \"Hard\" difficult, not \"Very Hard\". I typically expect VH to require some foreknowledge of what is to come, knowledge of specific builds, some grinding, and so on, so I choose H. This was a mistake, I guess. Even though I stopped doing the generic icon-hunts fairly early on (they're pointless, just chores to keep compulsive players either happy or addicted) I was still consistently over-leveled. Worse, I occasionally fought higher level monster (5-7 levels higher than me) and they were just as easy. Sure, they hit much harder and take much longer to kill, but there's no fundamental change. Patience is all you need. I also never needed to use oils or potions at all, didn't use bombs, and only used signs without upgrades. This is not bragging in any way, but a reflection of how easy the game was - I did use all of them initially, but it quickly became clear that their different was negligible and everything was really easy regardless. I died once against on boss and that was it.The start of the game was harder, but mostly because I didn't yet know the controls and dodging patterns. Later on, you could kill every monster by attacking twice and then dodging one attack (some enemies required two dodges). Again, it doesn't feel like you're playing a witcher. It's like a second level of pretending, you wave a stick in the air and the game congratulates you for a precise hit on a monster's weak point.I'll also reject the notion that NG+ is where it's at - you don't design a 70+ hour game (without expansions) with the intention of playing through it twice for it to get any good. 70 hours is plenty of time to learn the details of every system in a single playthrough.There are other minor complaints like how the game is bloated to no end. Lots of additional mini-games and options that are extremely under-designed. One example, horse racing is a matter of holding shift and occasionally turning the horse. It rarely gets out of stamina, and even when it does the opponent doesn't try to overtake you.Another example, there are like 5 haircuts and another 5 beard styles in the game, with barbers throughout. But every barber has the same 5 styles, whether you're in viking land or you're in the elite city. (I never used it and couldn't care less, but I think it is a clear example of the game adding \"stuff\" with no depth at all, it simply bloats the game).That said, the game is \"very good\", if you're expecting a run of the mill game. The writing is great, and very much in line with the novels (of which I'm not the greatest fan, but they're alright and the tone is preserved here - \"campy\" is a good description; Skellige is basically a mishmash of vikings and celts, where vikings wear horned helmets and the \"celts\" use 18th century scottish tartan for clan colors - which is to say it is inspired by history as much as it is by stereotypes, but in a self-aware way. It's not my favourite style of writing, but again, it fits the books and is \"well written\").Since I ran out of words, I'll leave the praise to others.",

        "text": "Eeeeeeh. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game, but it didn't satisfy me at all as I finished it.This is like a super-competent flash game more than a real strategy game. Plus it has a really cool historical component.The problem I have with the game is that it is mostly about event rather than systems. Many of the game's challenges change important variables simply as a way of creating artificial barriers to fit historical timelines. For example, in the last stretch of the unification of Egypt, where you subdue the last tribes, they are too powerful for you. It's unreasonable for you to fight them, almost impossible with the game's balance up to that point. Once you gain the quest to unite the last tribes, though, you gain a bonus that makes them much weaker than before. So now you can go and subdue them with the same army you had before.Most of the game's events are like this. The \"routine\" management and strategy aspects aren't very deep, and when a major event needs to happen (with roughly the same timeline as real history), the game changes its rules.The strategy aspect then suffers a lot, since you can't plan very well, unless you have played the game before and know what is going to happen and when.I have only played the game on \"easy\" mode (the game offers different modifiers when you start the game, and I chose the recommended settings for beginners), but not \"extra easy\" mode, which the game offers halfway through. There are two higher difficulties which I am sure are more challenging - but this challenge has more to do with foreknowledge than with mechanical mastery.I often think of Europa Universalis for historical dynamics done right. In that game, many mechanics also act as barriers, but behave as systems rather than timed gates controlled by the developers. The best example was the Casus Beli. You can't start a war if you don't have a cause. This is the mechanic, and it reflects history to some extent - in geopolitics, you can't just attack everyone like a madman without expecting other countries to promptly eliminate you; there are social/moral norms applied to politics within the european states. To declare a war, then, you can use causes like \"I held this  province 10 years ago and I want to reclaim it\", or use marriage ties. Furthermore, you can also use spies to forge claims, which may succeed, or fail and give you a reputation hit among other states. You learn the historical dynamics by understanding what you can and cannot do, and then everyone plays by the same rules. It's a \"simulation\".This game isn't a simulation. The other tribes don't have the same variables as you have. There isn't much simulation, here. What there is is a relatively fixed sequence of events between which you have some degree of control, but not much.The whole game is kind of a min-max race. And early mistakes can have big costs later on, since the game plays like a snowball.Other than that, the only criticism I have is that the research trees (building and research) are a bit too abstract. Even though you are following a historical sequence (like building Scorpion's or Narmer's tomb, the Temple of the Sun, discovering slavery, taxation, and so on) the way choices are presented make them too abstract. It all boils down to which number you want to increase right now. I haven't even read the name of the chosen research half of the time, all that mattered was the stats associated.This is a problem when a game is so focused on the historical particulars as Predynastic Egypt is. Despite being historical, the information that actually matters in the players' heads become abstract and ahistorical in a self-defeating way.That said, I can give a mild recommendation. I enjoyed my time with it. Although it has very limited replayability (unless you want to optimize a more or less fixed sequence of events), the presentation is great and it does make an attempt to present an accurate historical game, which I'd like to see more of. Of course, it's always a balance between history and playability, but it's good that they are trying to explore the often neglected side!It's also cheap, so it can be a good palate-cleanser between meatier games.

        "text": "It's okay. I'm not the biggest fan of the writing - the world is somewhat interesting, but the game never goes in-depth about it.I like the themes, but not the treatment. It doesn't present logical character, but emotional ones. It's all an allegory for inclusion and human arrogance.Mechanically, it's definitely a step in the right direction! It is a very tentative step, however, since the extra mechanics aren't really fleshed out of used in a very interesting way. Basically, you're a post-human, with augmentations - not unlike what you would find in Deus Ex. So you play through a simple detective story where you use your augments in addition to combining toothbrushes with broken lightbulbs to fix wind turbines.While the game claims you have to \"live with your choices\", this is not really the case in any meaningful extent. Sure, there is no saving/loading, but there aren't many meaningful choices either. The personality mechanic is barely used, too. The biggest problem, to me, is that you still have to solve every puzzle in more or less the same way. You don't have enough freedom to actually explore and collect evidence and later on reconstruct the events - instead, you enter a room and the game doesn't let you live until you \"find everything you need to find\".The worst scene in the game was when you had to talk a crazed person out of killing you - but you had no real tools or consequence to deal with it. So the scene degenerated into you picking whatever dialogue choice seemed appropriate, only to have the crazed person shoot and kill you and force you to restart the scene - until you found the right sequence through trial and error.Not unlike Deus Ex, the most powerful augment is reloading a save.Overall, I don't think it's really worth playing, unless you really enjoy point n' click games. Technobabylon or Primordia are more interesting takes on the same themes (although I liked the \"Blue\" idea in the game - there was a hinted at but not explicit implication that was interesting).I'll live the review as a mild recommendation for the attempts to change the formula a bit and taking the genre in a more mechanical direction. It's a competent game, but doesn't go beyond that.",

        "text": "I really like the atmosphere of the game, and it looks great (like a much better version of Rift Racer).While there seems to be great depth to the mechanics of the game as a challenging platformer (given by the amount of hours put in by many players, as well as the robust leaderboard, workshop and ghost system in the game), it doesn't work at all for me - it is basically a first-person bit.trip runner game.The problem is that you can't see \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 coming, the game is almost impossible to parse at the difficult sections, and barely beyond driving in a straight line in other sections.If you're okay with almost pure memorization and learning individual levels (through trial-and-error and observation of other players' ghosts), this may work for you; otherwise, stay away.Obstacles always materialize in front of you at weird angles, and the aesthetic doesn't communicate information very well. Worse yet is the level design that doesn't really build on established patterns. If it did, the game may have worked, since you at least had an idea of what to expect from the next obstacle. Instead, the game throws random stuff at you that you can't see. Not very fun, to me.It's very weird. The game entices you with a really great atmosphere, but the actual content would be better without such an atmosphere, since it actually hurts information. It's a bait-and-switch. Clearly, I haven't given the game a great amount of time. I've beaten the first campaign, tried the second, and played a couple of community levels. The game seems to be built for speedrunning, optimizing air time and finding skip-paths. That's all fine, if that's what you're looking for. It's not what I was looking for, though, and neither is it what the game signals itself to be.",

        "text": "This is almost painful to review. I guess this is what happens when a talented and experienced company makes a game to prolong its precarious existence. Although I no longer find ARPGs very good games, I think Torchlight (I and II) are good games within the genre, so I like Runic Games! But this game is rather soulless, really.Hob is an action-adventure game not unlike Zelda. It has some metroidvania trappings, but those are very light - sure, the world is open and interconnected, but you never need to create a map of it in your head and note possible uses of newly acquired powers - this is an even more linear version than traditional metroidvanias.The problem is that there is no motivation for you to progress in the game. In the first 75% of the game, you are basically pressing a button to open the path to the next button. Seriously. There's no reason for you to be doing anything except that you see a button or a lever, which opens a path, at the end of which is another lever, which activates an elevator that takes you to yet another button. This goes on for several hours.You're doing things in the world, but none of it is intentional - you, the character and player, are just following the buttons. At the end, all of this button pressing results in a substantial change in the world, but it does not depend in any way on a concerted effort from you.It's like wizard of Oz. Most games at least give you the illusion of purpose. Here the curtain is drawn all the way back and you see the man pulling all the levers (or, rather, you're the one doing all the pulling).There are puzzle, which involve more buttons, levers, and occasional boxes. Unfortunately, these aren't real \"puzzles\" - the game doesn't have a well established set of rules with which it tests you in progressively harder puzzles. No, here the puzzles are merely contrived chains of actions. Again, following buttons. This is a common practice in most adventure games, but it's secondary to the adventure - not here.There is also combat, platforming, and hidden upgrades (mostly health and energy upgrades, with the occasional combat move or modifiers - but these don't play a major role).The upgrades are simply there because it's a staple of the genre. It doesn't add much to the game other than looking around for them and getting a little dopamine reward to keep you going.The combat was fairly good - it was methodical, not just about spamming. You sometimes had to block, dodge, or use your special glove to break the enemy's armour. There were quite a few different enemies with their unique patterns. The problem is the lack of cancelling. On Hard mode it could become a bit tedious since later enemies are quite spongy - and it isn't very interesting to repeat the same \"recipe\" over and over to down a single enemy.The platforming was almost fun! This was probably my favourite aspect of the game - except that the camera perspective sometime tricks you, and the game's context-based ledge grabbing was rather inconsistent. Some later jumps were quite punishing (throwing you a long way back if you missed) which was extremely annoying and unfair when due to unpolished gameplay.The reason for the platforming to be so good (when it works) is that the world is beautifully crafted. Seriously, it's all one piece, with lots of moving parts and a lot of vertical movement. It feels good and gives you quite a bit of freedom. Which makes the game all the more unfortunate - you can see tons of work and talented has been poured into this, but there's no real gameplay or story reason for Hob to exist.I feel like it was trying to follow games like Journey and Abzu, but for some reason felt the needed to extend its playtime to 10 hours - which it did by spreading the plot extremely thinly and adding many buttons and levers to keep you moving until \"players got their money\".Repeating what I said at the beginning of the review, this is painful. Hob has an amazingly crafted world full of quirky creatures and attention to detail, but it lacks a heart. It's difficult to put my finger on what exactly is wrong (other than the whole button thing) but the game feels really purposeless and devoid of meaning. And that's really unfortunate, given the palpable talent... ",

        "text": "I wanted to give this game a negative review - but it's a testament to how good the bit.trip runner formula is that the game is still very satisfying despite some scummy design!Runner3 is more like Runner2 than Runner1. While the levels are much more complex than in the first game, and have some really fun sections, a lot of the design is either unfair and unsatisfying or simply unrelated to what makes the series good.The biggest problem, to me, is how much the game obscures collectibles and obstacles with foreground elements. There are too many sections where you can't see what's coming next until it's too late, forcing you to rely of memorization a lot more than reflex and quick-planning.This applies not only to foreground elements obscuring obstacles but also indistinct enemy design (poor color and silhouette coding, you often can't read things at a glance), changes of perspective (making it very hard to judge distances), obstacles falling out of the sky or moving around too close to the player, and so on.I think I could go on, but you get the idea. And let me be clear - these are not \"mistakes\" by the developers who didn't know better; this is part of the design. It's very clear that they used all of these things intentionally. I don't get why, it adds challenge, sure, but it's not where the fun of the game is at!There are also some really scummy obstacles or gold/gem placements that are purposefully there to make you miss them right before the end of a level, forcing a full restart (as opposed to a checkpoint restart).There are minor problems, some carried from Runner2 like the cannon at the end of a level which is required to \"perfect\" levels (mostly for achievements, I guess, but who doesn't like to strive for reasonable perfection?). The cannon has nothing to do with the skill set of the actual game.There are also too many driving sections which stop being about jumping, sliding and kicking, and instead become about moving around freely up/down or left/right. Again, these have nothing to do with the bit.trip runner skill set. There are too many of these sections within levels.Finally, there are too many collectables (stickers, hero quests, \"retro levels\", etc.) that inflate the game's length with little (in my opinion) added value. The stickers, for example, often force you to forego coins/gems in a level to collect them - but the level design doesn't actually change, it's a tiny branch dedicated entirely to the sticker just to make you replay a level.The hero quests follow a similar logic, except that you must first \"activate\" the quest in another level to make the collectable available.The retro levels are simply normal platforming levels. These are more like a poor man's Mario or Super Meat Boy, really. They're there if you want to collect special coins to buy costumes in the shop. I didn't really play these, but it is a bit annoying that time was spent adding all of this pointless stuff that has nothing to do with the game itself, you know, about running and rhythm.Otherwise, the game is really fun! I completed every gold/gem in every normal level - the impossible levels were a bit too frustrating so I decided not to play them at this time.I'm not a big fan of the difficulty options since they make it a bit hard to judge what the developers intended. I ended up playing with all the options maxed out and it was alright (again, except for the impossible levels, but those are called impossible so yeah).Would be nice to have aggregate leaderboard scores (for each world or full campaign rather than individual levels, but it's not too relevant).Mechanics-wise, I actually like the double jump and the stomp quite a lot. These give you a lot more control over how to tackle different challenges and how to react (when the level design isn't scummy). The jump height is often difficult to judge, however (due to the 3D and shifting perspective) and there is also lack of feedback for when you hit the ground - I died often because I \"air jumped\" rather than \"jumped\" because I jumped just before the character hit the ground; this could be solved with a sound or a controller rumble, but it was more of a problem at the beginning.Excuse me for the rambling review. I really love the series and feel like this game had some really bad design elements. That said, I played the first game again and the level design was much, much simpler. So, taking my rosy-colored glasses off, I think the level design is, on the whole, better in Runner3. It could easily be better than it is, but it's still very fun.I don't remember 2 very well, should replay it at some point. But anyway. That's enough.I'm a bit annoyed at the game, but Runner3 is still very satisfying to play! Especially if you go for higher challenges - there are enough degrees of difficulty and achievements for most people to find a satisfying way to play the game. ",

        "text": "This is both much better and much worse than I expected.I expected a very poor, barely functional game. Then I realized the game was more complex than I expected, and seemed quite deep and got my hopes up. Finally, I realized how much of a slog it really is - the game is too padded, with dozens of encounters that present no new challenge whatsoever.The first big problem of the game is the UI/UX. This is a mobile port and it shows in many very important ways.Every button is too large; everything requires going deep in to menus, taking too many clicks for basic actions; the main combat screen provides you with maybe 5% of all the useful information it should, instead forcing you to go (again) deeper into menus, or selecting each character individually before you know everything you need to make a decision. For example,  only absolute HP is shown when you hover over a character - not its max hp, for you to decide whether or not to heal; you are not given \"reachable\" tiles for moving or attacks; you're not given hit % chances; to quickly check the HP and Mana of each party member, you need to select them individually rather than having miniature portraits with simple bars.I could go on.The quality of life features that the game is missing is immense. It's probably difficult to maintain a \"complex\" RPG for both PC and mobile, but the result is that this doesn't meet any PC RPG standard, and becomes clunkier and slower than it should.The second, more important, problem is density. I mean density in what you, as the player, experience. It is sparse in almost every category. In 6 hours, I've only seen caverns. There was a town with 3 or 4 buildings, but it was still an underground town that provided little variety. The game only has 2 music tracks, apparently, \"in combat\" and \"out of combat\" - and, of course, \"silence\". These are rather superficial, but they're important when the game design doesn't hold by itself.The problem with the combat is that (1) dungeons are too large and (2) specific battles are neither meaningful nor challenging. In 6 hours, I've been through 3 \"dungeons\" or areas. They've all been roughly the same. Not only that, they've been quite long. The enemies have come in 3 varieties, roughly - archer, warrior, and shaman. Archers attack from a distance, warriors attack from up close. Shamans are kind of like archers but they sometimes buff their allies. This is it. There are \"varieties\" of each, but none of them requires me to change the strategy. Having many different enemies is meaningless if this number has no influence in how one plays the game! This is the single most important aspect, so far, and the one that made me decide not to play this anymore.The AI is also no good. The terrain is \"heterogeneous\", meaning you will be able to find strategic positions in most battles. This is almost good! But the problem is that they all degenerate into \"place your tank in a single tile corridor and your ranged/support units behind him\". Enemies will then be forced to attack you one at a time. This has worked for just about every encounter, so far. Even when there is a way to flank me by going around the corridor and get on my backside, the enemies just ignore it and wait until their friend dies to take his place.I'm not entirely convinced about the classes, as their skills aren't very varied or interesting. They rely mostly on too specific or too general buffs (too specific like a lightning mage buffing only his own lightning attacks, or too general like the cleric giving everyone more defense). I haven't seen any good interaction between the characters. I suppose more complex elemental attacks play a role later on (I realize I'm very early in the game - but 6 hours of nothing isn't very promising, and reading other reviews shows that the trend continues with many hours of emptiness before some new gameplay element becomes relevant).The leveling up also seems too linear. Since each character had maybe 5 or 6 different abilities, the rest becomes simply a sink to make the same abilities more powerful.The final important point I want to make is about the underlying stat system. This is a problem I have with DnD games in general, but it is worse here. The game mechanics are too opaque. The game relies on too many dice rolls and doesn't explain them properly - nor does it give you enough feedback to understand why you're missing or making so little damage.It's fine if you like reading about the calculations before/after playing the game (there is a guide by the developers on this, on Steam but not the game itself), but that's too much like following a guide. I like to learn how the game works by myself and discover cool tactics on my own. But this is impossible when the game is too opaque and doesn't give you any information about the variables you can control.I don't want to be too hard on the game. I more or less enjoyed my time with it. But that last 3 hours, once the discovery period was over, have been rather tedious. And, above all else, the game doesn't promise much. I don't expect much to change. And since I am not looking for a time sink, I'd rather play something else.It is very impressive that two people made this, and that the game is apparently still being updated 6 years after release (with the team maintaining other games at the same time!). For a combat focused RPG, the encounters were all too similar, and too long. I feel like Baldur's Gate's system, at best, works brilliantly in boss fights. Buffing is quite tedious to maintain when fighting cannon fodder for dozens of hours. But bosses are unique, with strengths and weaknesses you're able to exploit with different spells and team compositions. In my 6 hours, Heroes of Steel has only shown the tedious and laborious fodder side.I don't think this is worth playing, BUT -I am looking forward to playing Trese Brothers' other games. I assume they will have improved over this.P.S.: I forgot to add. The game is sorely missing better AOE abilities and positional modifiers. The irregularly shaped terrain would provide good positioning-focused gameplay, and a lot more variety in fodder battles. This would only be augmented if you could attack characters from the back/side. Furthermore, the AOE in the game isn't very clear on who will be hit, and most cases seem too simple like hitting everyone around a tile. The warrior was particularly disappointing in having only single target attacks. Some sweep or piercing attacks would have made it significantly better. Similarly with the archer, having some scattershot or rain of arrows or something. The game just needs more variety to make the combat interesting.",

        "text": "Not much to say about this one.Flipping Death is a more modern take on the old-school point n' click adventure games - one that doesn't rely on pointing and clicking! This is a very welcome change, to me. The puzzles are perhaps as contrived as the puzzles of old, but the game is well aware of this problem and silently points you in the right direction in a smooth way. The contrived nature of the puzzles is also complemented by the writing.If you've played Zoink's other games, Stick it to the Man! and Zombie Vikings, you know what you're getting into. This game is very similar to their first game. The mechanics are different, but the spirit is the same.The music and voice acting are really well done, and so is the graphical style (allowing for some buggy physics-based animations).I'm not a big fan of referential humour but you'll definitely find some here. Not in an obnoxious way, fortunately!Honestly, I found the gameplay a bit tedious at times. It's not a very mechanical game at all, and it's mostly about possessing everyone in the level, first, to learn of the problems each character is facing and who may provide solutions to those problems. Once you figure some of the quests out, all else kind of falls into place in a chain.It's an amusing game, if not very meaningful. Very stylish.As I said, it's like an old-school adventure game, but with more modern gameplay. If you like adventure games, especially stuff like Grim Fandango, I think you'll enjoy this one.",

        "text": "This is honestly one of the worst games I've played. I have not enjoyed a single mission, so far. And most of them were infuriating, which is why I am not playing this any more. Nothing good has come out of it in the first half, so I doubt any good will come now.There are three main points I want to emphasize, the last of which is really what made me drop the game.First, it suffers from the same problems as older D&D based RPGs like Baldur's Gate; second, it suffers from the same problem as Fallout 2 where you spend 80% of the battles waiting for the enemies' turns (because enemies far outnumber you and are extremely slow); third, every level is either brainless filler, or a contrived gimmick. Regarding the problem with D&D based games - martial classes suck, with an extremely limited ability set. Only mages have a wide array of spells that you can use creatively at all and which make the game interesting. Unfortunately, so far, there is only one mage companion, although you could have a second mage as your main character. I didn't know the companions would be this limited, so I made my main character an archer, since there was no archer in the companions - so I got one mage, one single character that is fun and tactical to play.The spells aren't very creative, either, or useful - especially since you must almost focus exclusively on leveling up a single spell for it to be useful (for example, \"cure poison\" works in tiers, and the enemies will quickly use high tiers of poison, forcing you to spend too many experience points to make such a spell useful, thus limiting what other spells you can have to widen the toolbox).Martial classes have 3-4 abilities at most, but they are little more than \"do slightly more melee damage\".Ok, about the second problem. This is pretty self explanatory, but I'll elaborate on mission design. Not only do enemies outnumber you, but they often spawn indefinitely. Sometimes they spawn infinitely, and sometimes they just spawn for a very long time. You don't really know which, because the game doesn't tell you anything. There is no way to speed battles up, either. Some of these enemies are even unreachable. There was a mission which had 9 archers shooting you from \"off the board\". But they would work like normal units. Each archer would take maybe 4 seconds per turn. A battle has dozens of turns. So for these archers auto-attacking alone, you would spend 10, 20 minutes just waiting. And there are many levels like this. There is so much time spent doing nothing, it's amazing to me how the designers didn't try to alleviate it in any way. It was an obvious problem in Fallout 2, a 20 year old game, for crying out loud!Ok, last problem. You know how RPGs let you build your party and learn the stat system and which skills to use against what, and so on? How you learn the skill system to overcome challenges? Yeah, this game using this as bait, but then every level relies on an entirely unique gimmick that nullifies most of your skills. One level has you run around pressing levers to open colored doors while a mage can mind control your party and is immune to mind control himself. Oh, and the levers are behind colored doors, only one of which can be open at any one time. And the doors are set up so that you must run from one side of the map to the other every time. And you can't kill the enemies before you go through the whole sequence because there are healing crystals next to the levers you need to destroy. Yeah, that's fun.Some other level relies entirely on setting fire to oil pools. Except that those oil pools are bubbling green, which makes them seem like poison and something you avoid, not something you try to shoot with fire.Several levels rely on closing doors to prevent monsters from infinitely spawning. The point is that most of the levels are really \"puzzles\" that have nothing to do with any kind of RPG skillset. In fact, they make most of the spells and attacks useless until you solve the gimmick.The other missions are literally just push overs. They're mindless. You just kill cannon fodder. There is neither strategy nor role-playing involved. The missions are designed to fill time and to present a poor gimmick that often relies on poorly communicated mechanics.So yeah. Honestly, I find this game a pure waste of time. There are other problems. The \"morality\" system is entirely black and white. You choose \"good\", or you choose \"bad\". For example, at one point I could free a dude or tie him up with ropes. He had information, so I wanted to tie him up, which could have been useful, right? Well, yeah, except that without any input from you, the game decided that \"tying him up\" actually meant \"kill him\". The equipment relies entirely on set bonuses, so single pieces of equipment are worthless. Either you use an entire set, or it doesn't matter. Not a very interesting system.The overworld map also seems non-linear, until you realize that each mission has a difficulty rating and you should just play them in order anyway.I could go on, but this is really nit-picking, now.I almost enjoyed this, at the beginning. But I realized that I was just frustrated on every single mission. So yeah. This is incredibly bad, in my opinion, and you should stay away if any of the issues I mentioned sound reasonable to you.",

        "text": "Initially, it is a very charming game of the likes of Zelda or Bastion. Unfortunately, it has absolutely terrible controls and framerate issues. This, paired with a difficulty spike halfway through thegame, with the dwindling of options (in terms of exploration and upgrades) results is a very poor experience overall. The game is amusing and light-hearted, but it's a case of \"style over substance\". The loop is very formulaic. And the controls are bad enough that the game can't provide a fair challenge. The lack of independent aiming (to attack a monster chasing you, you have to run away then flick the analog backwards to aim at the monster) combined with the minor stun when you're hit and the large amount of enemies make it very easy to get stunlocked and restart the dungeon through little fault of your own.Basically, you solve a bunch of over-world fetch quests and visit short dungeons to get upgrades.It's okay, at first. But it definitely overstays its welcome (I didn't finish it) and, again, the difficulty plus the poor controls make it no worth playing, in my opinion.It looks great (though not in action because of the framerate issues) and the music is great too - almost like a \"lite\" version of Diablo Swing Orchestra. As a game, though, it leaves too much to be desired.Get it cheap if you're curious, but don't expect too much.",

        "text": "This is a very nice little game. It won't blow your socks off, but it was exactly what I needed. I had been playing Legends of Eisenwald, which was a long, dense, and often frustrating game, so I wanted something lighter - which Steel Sword Story provided!I played 1001 Spikes a few months ago and I think that is one of the best platformers out there. It was very difficult, but always fair. It was very demanding, though - you could easily spend 20 minutes on a 20 seconds level later on.Still, that game left me perfectly satisfied after beating the main campaign with all the collectables.SSS isn't the same kind of game at all. It doesn't require a tenth of the precision and memorization that 1001 Spikes did. It is also not about mastery in the same way - after beating on of those 20 minutes levels once, I could often beat it in maybe 2 minutes the second time! Beating a level once meant you were 85% of the way to mastering it.SSS is a much more casual experience. The game is rather unassuming and doesn't try to do anything new. It's a 2D sidescroller of the old-school kind. It's simple, but it's solid. It isn't punishing at all, which was welcome - dying merely meant you had to start the stage from the beginning, but you could keep whatever upgrades and gems you found. I liked the enemy design - throughout the game, there are only a few different kinds of enemies, but their patterns build up in complexity as you go along.The game was a bit on the easy side (even on \"Gamer\" mode, which is the only difficult above \"Easy\"), although the last level ramped up the difficulty for a good closing.The game is very short, too. I beat it in 3 hours the first time and immediately started it again, now with all the upgrades I had found. I beat it in 30 minutes on this second time.The presentation is great, both the pixel art and the music were very reminiscent of the old Nintendo games, in the best way! The only problem I had was in the last boss, where the colors and the background made it difficult to parse what was going on.I had no issues with the low framerate reported by most negative reviewers - maybe I was lucky. But they offer a benchmark tool, so you should know whether or not you'll have any problem.The controls were good, for the most part, although occasionally unresponsive.Not much more to say about it. It's a simple and short game, but it was exactly the kind of game I wanted to play! It doesn't bite more than it can chew - it doesn't do anything surprising, but it's good at what it does.If you're looking for a good, short, old-school 2D action platformer, give it a go.",

This game has some of the best writing I've seen in a game yet. The writing isn't good in flavor or style but actual content. This blows Baldur's Gate (I and II) out of the water by miles and miles. It has a lot to zoom into if you want.Initially, I really loved how the game manages to use legends and folk-tales in side-quests in a way that not only ties in with the main plot, but also to flesh out the world and characters. You can see characters retelling the same story with their own biases and agendas. You can see naturalistic stories become distorted when they are retold from hear-say. It's really cool.The main plot was initially frustrating, to me. The game starts you off in a state full of bad people. Everyone is despicable, and you need to choose who to ally with. Characters often have incontrovertible conflicts that force you to kill at least one of them with no possibility of resolution. It was just the opposite of most cRPGs - not only were you prevented from being \"good\", but you were very limited in your choices. It seemed like a fairly boring and edgy way to write, I wasn't a fan. It didn't say anything meaningful, but merely said the opposite of the standard games.Then it got good. Then the game started playing around with its theme, showing variations of the basic premise in a way that wasn't as black and white.By the end, it had a pretty deep idea about the nature of power and virtue, in a very medieval way.I won't go in more depth. But I can tell you the writing is very, very good. It's not inspiring or enjoyable at all. It's quite misanthropic, and it rarely gives you the tools to make good choices. But if you can let go of your cRPG expectations, this is good.The aspect I'm most torn about is the gameplay. I really like it, it's both unique and reflects well on the historic period the game is set in. But there are some extremely infuriating design decisions (often resulting in you having to reset the whole chapter because of an obstacle you couldn't have predicted nor have the ability to respond to); the game also has a very bad habit of taking all your companions, equipment and money away between chapters - and so every chapter becomes quite formulaic in having to grind slowly to build your team again. While I enjoyed the systems, I don't think they were very good for this kind of repetition.The same can be said of the combat. It is unique, but it's very strange, and doesn't fit perfectly with the RPG notion of having stats and equipment. Positioning and attack order become difficult to account for with so many confounding stats. Chess is good because the rules are very clear. It also suffers from \"combat fatigue\" of games like Final Fantasy - you'll fight so many battles that it becomes extremely tedious. Fortunately, the game has an \"auto-fight\" feature! It is very welcome, but you can only use it on your turn, and have to go through the combat loading screen and some animations, which can take longer than it would be ideal.I nearly dropped the game at least twice. Probably there were some minor times, too. I hated it. But it's so good!Honestly, this is far, far from perfect. Initially, it reminded me of the first two Fallouts. But it's even worse than those games in its rough edges! Fortunately, I also found the writing to be deeper, so it compensates.It's a very bipolar game, to me. I can't in good conscience recommend this to most people - knowing how frustrating it was for me at times. But if you're willing to steel your nerves and want to bite into a different kind of cRPG, definitely try this out. I'm extremely impressed, honestly. I want to try out their other games, but I definitely need a break after this. It's a dense and exhausting game. But I find the writing to be leagues ahead of Dragon Age's, Baldur's Gate's, The Witcher's, and I could go on.",

        "text": "I hadn't played Bastion in years.The thing I (and, I assume, most other people) remembered was the style. The music, especially, stuck with me and I still pay some of the tunes every once in a while on the slide guitar.What I didn't remember at all was how good (or not) the gameplay was.So here's the deal - the gameplay isn't very innovative or enthralling in its basics. It's working within a fairly standard action adventure framework. That said, they've designed the way in just about the best way they could have within those constraints.I have recently played Yaga, which made me replay Bastion because of some similarity between the two games.Yaga was extremely easy, despite having very similar basics.Bastion, however, did a lot more. First, the weapon system is really great. Each weapon has some kind of timing attack, and aiming/positioning is important too. Every weapon changes the game and allows for skill to develop in a really cool way. The enemies are much better, too, since they all telegraph their attacks for you to work with your parrying shield (also timing based).Beyond this, I really like how the game offers you extras throughout. You have a handy upgrade system, but not enough shards or XP to take full advantage of it. So they give you idols, which are difficulty modifiers for a small bonus. If you think you can handle, you can make things harder on yourself.There are also weapon-focused challenge levels which (some of them, anyway) require you to really up your game, especially regarding the timing. These are really cool - not just an optional challenge, but something that demands some skill build-up on the player's part.Finally, there are survival-like levels. Arenas with a fixed number of waves and backstory in between. These can be challenging (depending on the idols) and require some careful conservation of health.Leveling up also lets you equip more perks, which may carry both positives and negatives.Building your character isn't very deep, but it presents enough interesting decisions.So yeah. Not much of a review, but I thought I'd write about my current thoughts on the game - mostly on the game design rather than the aesthetics, which I remembered fairly well.One final note - while the narration is very stylish, I don't find it very good, narratively. A lot of the narration happens during combat; even when it happens in between, it's likely that you will be thinking about the next encounter rather than piecing the rather vague story on your head. So there's that. The narrator definitely adds a lot of style to the game, but I don't think it delivers the story in a very good way. Guess you can't have it all!Regardless, the game is absolutely worth playing for the music and its implementation alone. And under that, while not a revolutionary game, you will find a very solid one.",

        "text": "[EDIT: Since this confusion arised in one comment, I'll make it clear right away - I use the term ARPG exclusively to mean Diablo-like games, and not more modern RPGs like Fallout or Mass Effect.]Titan Quest is a very traditional ARPG, with a more epic campaign that has you travel from Greece to Egypt, Babylon, China, and Mount Olympus, in contrast with the more local likes of Diablo and Torchlight.In my Torchlight review, I have already pointed out where I feel like the genre fails. This has the same problem, as did Diablo (including II), so it will be a short review.First off, the game is still very pretty, despite its age. It's a rare case of a game that didn't shoot itself in the foot by going 3D instead of sprite-based. The music was also really nice, and fit the different places well.The world building was nice, but also disappointing at times. For example, a place called \"Mycenaean ruins\" was really just a greek temple ruin, with all the traditional architectural elements of classical rather than mycenaean greece. The Great Wall of China, despite the game taking place sometimes BCE, also looked like the modern wall of China, rather than the ancient one. But anyway. These are really nitpicks, this is not an Assassin's Creed game where historical reconstruction is a main goal. The main cities themselves (including the Mycenaean palace at Knossos) were accurate, as far as I could tell, with sacrifices being made mostly on the generic dungeons and tombs required of the genre.Anyway.There are two main points I want to raise - density and response.DensityI'm stealing the term \"density\" from a Jonathan Blow talk about the game 1001 Spikes. There, he mentioned how each level required a lot of the player. Each section taught you something and probably showed you new ways to approach previous sections. The point was that it was constantly engaging with the player.ARPGs, traditionally, are the opposite. You find thousands of enemies, go through dozens of identical dungeons, spend hours in identical terrain, \"deforesting\" an area of enemies and waiting for the next level or piece of randomized loot.The time I spent actually engaged was minimal, and I assume it is the same for most players.Don't get me wrong, I find the gameplay extremely satisfying! It feels great to gather 10 or 20 enemies around you and stomp the ground and make them all explode. The main loop is great for these large sections of combat. But there is a limit. After 5 hours, I was a bit bored with it. After 15 hours, I was extremely bored. At 20 hours, I decided I'd had enough.There is a bigger problem, here, in how the skill trees work. First, there aren't all that many skills that you actively use, so the gameplay doesn't change very much once you've acquired the abilities you wanted. Then, you still need to put a lot of pointless points into the trees. In this case, you have to spend points to simply unlock the ability to unlock abilities in the tree. That's a mouthful. What I mean is that abilities are \"tiered\". You need to spend 5 points to unlock abilities of Tier 1, then 10 points for Tier 2, etc.; and these aren't useful point at all. These are points IN abilities. Then, once you get the abilities, you still have to spend 12 point to max them out. Of the \"1% -> 1.1%\" kind.So there isn't really a lot going on. This is my problem with density, or, well, sparseness. Traditional ARPGs are extremely sparse. They take a satisfying loop and stretch it far too thinly. Sure the scenery changes every 3-5 hours in Titan Quest, but that isn't enough, for me. The second problem is related to this, which I'll address now.ResponseThis is about the fixed nature of the skill trees. In Diablo and Torchlight, you can't respec your character. Also, the game typically starts incredibly easy, and then it does a 180 degree turns and become very hard, usually because it introduces a new challenge - in Torchlight was elemental damage - that you can't really foresee. These two factors combined make for a terribly designed game, as you play the game and have fun with a build, and then the game decides to turn the tables, to which you can't adapt. Sure, you can try to find equipment that is better suited to some challenge or other, but the randomized and sparse nature of good drops make that rather impractical. Worse are the skill trees. If you make a mistake, you can't fix it. Now, in Titan Quest, you can reassign SOME points. You can reassign ability points. That's something - although it is costly, gold is rather useless otherwise, so that's something. But you can't choose a different mastery - masteries are like \"classes\", of which you can choose two. You can't lower the number of points you've put into the masteries. You can't reallocate stat points either.The bigger point, however, is that (1) you choose masteries blindly, it's not an informed decision at all and (2) you can't experiment at all.About the blind point - you can't actually try a mastery before you pick it. And, once you pick it, it's permanent. So this is a terrible system from the get go. You can read the skill descriptions, but that's far from actually trying them in action. Your choice is based on aesthetic alone.This is a really terrible design template, to me. It forces players to read about skill trees and optimal builds online instead of discovering those builds themselves. It also relates to the matter of density, since the game could be much more fun if you could (and maybe even had to!) adapt to different \"environments\" (enemy types, mostly) through the use of different skill combinations, and it would give you something else to do other than spam auto attack for 30 hours.Finally, also related to density, is how these games are stretched for 30 hours. Which seems incredibly dumb to me. ARPGs are well known for having many classes and builds. But not only are you prevented from experimenting with them, you also need to play for 20-30 hours to try a new build. It would seem to make much more sense to have a shorter game, replayable, that would let you play more classes and more combinations.Diablo 1 was inspired by Moria, a rogue-like game (the actual Rogue game). Maybe ARPGs would benefit from going back to rogue-liTes, the modern ones. In terms of structure, it would seem to make a lot of sense. The randomized loot is already a strong component of rogue-lites, and the shorter loop would allow for far more experimentation regarding classes, and so on.Finally, I also find the individual ability upgrades very boring. Essentially, they're all about increasing damage. There are ablities which are passive and have a % chance of triggering. Why not increase their triggering chance? Or, in the case of chain attack, the range of the chain, or the % of chaining to another enemy? Etc. Etc. There is a huge space you could experiment with regarding what to improve in each ability. But these games take the most boring route.I am curious to try Path of Exile, as that game has skills tied to items rather than fixed skill trees, while the skill tree is more about passive effects (that affect skills more generally). But that'll be for another time.To conclude: if you enjoy ARPGs, you'll probably enjoy this. I find the genre itself to be very flawed, despite the very satisfying basic gameplay. But I think that some changes could make it much, much better.",

        "text": "Defender's Quest is, as the description says, a tower defense game with RPG elements. I do, however, question its three focuses of \"tactical depth, customization, and story\".Despite the \"negative\" review, the game isn't terrible. At all. It is actually entertaining, and it works well, so you will probably enjoy it if you're looking for a casual tower defense game to play, and one to last you many hours. I have 17 hours on record: 10 of those were back in 2014, but I've since forgotten my time with the game, and decided to try it again, clocking at 7 hours to beat the main game. Although you may find the campaign rather short at 7 hours (or 10 on my first playthrough), there was a lot left undone.Anyway. If the game is entertaining and long, why the negative review? Well, I find that the game is fundamentally flawed in its approach to progress and \"tactical depth\".The game is structured as a fairly linear sequence of levels, with occasional towns where you can buy new and better equipment, or recruit more heroes. Heroes in this game act as towers. Each hero has a class and its own skill tree (although they are the same for each class) and can equip a weapon and a piece of armor. They also gain XP. This is the extent of the RPG elements.Each level has 3 blue stars to be earned, and each star can also be golden, if you \"perfect\" a level by completing it without getting hit. Each difficulty level earns you its respective star and those of easier difficulties.The fundamental flawThe fundamental flaw is the progression, and how it actually removes 90% of its \"tactical depth\". Tower defense games are kind of the staple of tactical games. Enemies walk on fixed paths, and you have to figure out the placement and combination of towers that most efficiently prevents those enemies from reaching a base. The problem with DQ is that this largely done away with by the way the RPG elements are implemented, and subsequent levels designed. A level, instead of a fixed problem you need to figure out, becomes instead a \"skill check\" - and not a \"player skill\", but a \"character skill\". The scaling seems uncontrolled, and you don't play the game in a straight line - you go back to earlier levels, to play them on higher difficulties, earn more XP and money, buy better equipment, and then attempt the newer levels again, once you're stronger. You complete a few levels, and hit another wall. Back you go to previous levels, upping the difficulty, and so on.The thing is that most of the levels become mind-numbingly easy. You speed the game up to 16x and perfect them on the highest difficulty with little trouble. And you do a few more levels like this. Once it gets difficult, you're probably ready to go back to the main quest for a few levels. It's a self-balancing mechanism that \"works\" but isn't really satisfying. You don't really have to try. You don't need to analyse levels carefully. In fact, I'd argue that you CAN'T do it. Because it's unclear whether you're finding a level difficult because you're playing badly, or simply because your characters aren't leveled up enough.And it's this uncertainty that kills the game, for me. If I knew I was strong enough to beat a level, I may have attempted it without the grind. But since you don't know, why bang your head against the wall? It's safer, easier, more reasonable to go back. Especially if, like me, you like to complete all the game has to offer.Finally, this is a problem that occurs everywhere in the game. The game has a few challenges, but these, too, are similarly affected by the level of your characters, so you may prefer to grind if they seem to difficult. NewGame+, too, continues the progression with tougher enemies and more powerful equipment, and lets you go back and forth between NG and NG+. So there aren't any fixed challenges, it seems. Maybe once you hit the level cap or attempt to complete the last levels on the highest difficulties in NG+?Anyway, I've probably made the point. There isn't much skill tree optimization, no careful timing of spells and tower upgrades during battles,  etc.; Not real \"tactical depth\".Possible solutionOne possibility to solve the problem above would be a leaderboard for efficiency. Something like SpaceChem, where the leaderboards track the resources used. This could be character experience, mana expended, etc. etc. So that you could see that other players had beat a level at some limited level, so you knew it to be possible and would then attempt it. This could require some serious optimization, which may not be everyone's cup of tea, but hey - it would mean far more depth.Instead of a leaderboard, you modify the star system to the same purpose - each star would limit your resources further.You get the idea. This would, of course, be a whole different game at that point. But anyway, perhaps it can better deliver the point of what I was looking for and how I feel like the game fails to deliver.ConclusionOther than the above, the game is quite alright. The story isn't terribly fascinating, and the dialogue's humor not my thing, but it's alright. The game looks good enough, and the speed options are very welcome. It has the \"flash game\" feel, but that's not a bad thing.If you're looking for a casual TD game, this is probably a very good choice. If you're looking for a tighter challenge, look elsewhere. I've enjoyed my time with the game, honestly. But I don't feel like continuing to play now that I beat the main campaign. Lots of people seem to enjoy it, so maybe you will, too.",

        "text": "I have written a long review about D&D RPG systems and the first two campaigns of NWN. It was too long for steam and I don't feel like compressing it.So here's the gist of it, in two main points:1. CombatIf you're new to D&D games, definitely play a spellcaster. The D&D system is cumbersome and extremely tedious for most martial classes. The problem is that martial classes have very few active abilities, so you must rely on auto-attacking and passive leveling skills. It's also not very clear when they activate from the textlogs alone, and the animations tell very little.Spellcasters, on the other hand, are interesting by giving you every spell available to your class/level - although the resting mechanic is also quite tedious.Boss fights are interesting because of the ability to adapt to each fight. The basic dungeoneering is not very fun AT ALL - personally, of course. Mostly because there are too many fights, and they aren't very difficult, so you have little need to adapt. It becomes a cycle of fighting, resting, buffing, and generally unresponsive combat.2. CampaignsThe first campaign, at least the first chapter, is pure filler. I dropped it.The second campaign, Shadow of the Undrentide, has a great first chapter! The quests are actually intertwined (so that you actually need to figure out compromises to solve every side of the conflict) and even dungeons have different approaches.The interlude and chapter 2, however, are filler once again, with a lot of padded dungeons.2. ConclusionThe biggest problem, honestly, is that I don't find the combat and leveling systems to be fun at all. Combat is clunky and tedious, seriously lacking in feedback and active abilities in most classes (WoW would be a great example here, where every class is very different, but \"equally\" active).The leveling, to me, is too sparse, and you don't have as much control as desirable. Fallout (1,2) was much better in this regard, to me. You could save more points to spend in specific \"attributes\" when needed, and many more of them seemed useful, unlike the attributes here. Even in Fallout it was problematic, but I feel like they're taking a much more versatile system that relies on players' imaginations and arguments in many more situations than are actually present in these \"premade\" videogames. The online component may alleviate this problem, but that's a whole other topic!In the end, I didn't enjoy it. The second campaign is \"better\", but not \"good\".Perhaps the third campaign is actually good (which I've heard). I need a break from this game now, however. May update the review once I play it.",

        "text": "Unfortunately not very good. Similar to Caravan in pacing - it starts how pretty good when you're learning the mechanics, but has a very weak late game and severe lack of narrative elements.You go around a kingdom, from city to city, buying low and selling high. That's the main loop - and I am consistently surprised with how addicting it is, to me. The game's production value was surprisingly high! Well, at least the map and the 2D elements. There are 3D minigames that honestly devalue the rest of the game. Still, they're easy to ignore.The biggest problem of the game is pacing. It's a bit like an S curve. It starts out slow, then it rapidly accelerates, and then it stagnates once again in the late game.At the beginning, while slow and difficult, the game is interesting. While there are few products you can buy and sell, there are many important mechanics for you to learn to manage your money. Travelling and storage costs, and also the random events that happen - which, in turn, are affected by \"luck\" which you can also control, to some extent, by buying some items or using the shaman in towns.Since you can only control cheap goods, it is very important that you can take advantage of fluctuations in price while you travel. There are also several side quests that help you do just that - these quests are narratively empty, but they help, mechanically. Essentially, you transport people from place to place, or go get a special good from one place and deliver it to another. Since their money rewards are relevant, at this point in the game, it is worth doing them, and they'll also give you an opportunity to explore all the cities and take advantage of fluctuations.This was the early game. So far, so good. I was enjoying the game quite a lot.Then, I understood the basic systems. I knew how to make money. So I upgraded my cart and was able to gain access to the more expensive goods, made quite a lot of money very quickly. This was the mid game, and was fairly short. Items and survival stopped being an issue at all. I could buy everything I wanted easily. Enter late game.Here, side quests are worthless. Here, a few things open up. You are able to clear mines of monsters, and use specialists to make money for you. You can travel through sea or air, instead of just land. You also gain access to \"partnerships\", meaning you can control more than one character.Unfortunately, none of these new systems are actually profitable, nor enjoyable. Controlling two character is simply tedious and more confusing, since you need to keep track of each character's stash, location, etc. - and they also become desynchronized in turns.To get specialists for the mines, you have to get lucky to find the \"right\" one (there are several kinds of \"mines\", each requiring a specialist), buy him, and take him to the mine - keeping track of which mines requires what, etc.. Not to mention that you have to buy dozens of mercenaries to clear the mines in the first place.As I said, money is no longer a problem at all, but it is quite tedious to do all of this.What's left? Well, the main quest. There are two parts to the main quest. The first, is the narrative. The second, is the \"guild\" quest, which you need to complete to trigger the main quest.The problem is that the guild quest is behind a money barrier. In the late game, it goes up to 2.5 million gold. You can expect, on average, a profit of 20 000 per trip. Which means that making the 2.5 million takes quite a while - and it is pure grind. Since the new mechanics are unprofitable, you simply need to spend some hours going back and forth, buying and selling the 2 or 3 important goods.The game has many small mechanics, which I did not explain. I hope this is enough for anyone to get an idea of what is wrong, however. The early game is good, although slow, since you're learning all of these details. The mid game is still good, but fast, during which you exploit what you're learned. In the late game, however, the game lacks balance. Although the mechanics are there and could be very interesting, they are quite tedious and awkward to interact with, and turn out very unprofitable, too. There are almost two very distinct games, here, between early and late game. The late game must be rebalanced to be fun.Finally, one problem that I had with Caravan, was the lack of narrative. There is some, but almost none, here.There are mines and monuments for you to clear, but these are completely bland. \"Clearing\" a monster is about sending people there. There could be cool legends of resources surrounding each place, but there is none.The game could also have some political plots in each act that affected the prices in some cities, but there is nothing.You get the idea.If you like buying low and selling high, you can enjoy this game. Especially the start of it! If you want something deeper, mechanically or narratively, you're probably better off looking elsewhere.",

        "text": "I really enjoyed Torchlight maybe 8 or 9 years ago.I've replayed it recently and find it a pretty terrible game.It's very similar to Diablo I in structure, although its pacing (which includes length and skill tree) are closer to Diablo II. Unfortunately, it's a straightforward tribute and suffers from exactly the same problems Diablo II did.There are three major problems that ruin the game, for me:(1) Extremely monotonous, formulaic and uniform structure. The game is purely about clearing dungeons. There is no real story or quests - the three side quests that exist do not change the experience in any way. You go through 4 identical floors of a dungeon. Then you have a boss fight. Then the theme changes, the enemies change, and the cycle repeats. This goes on 7 times (for 35 floors).You don't really explore or exploit anything in the dungeons. They also get longer for no reason. In most games, you would call this \"filler\". The combat is fun, but it is also rather compulsive. It's satisfying to crowd control, but there isn't much to it beyond visceral satisfaction.(2) Game is about PLANNING rather than RESPONDING. You get 2 skill points per level (there are actually two different kinds of XP, each giving you one skill point - but that is largely irrelevant, since they are in synch). Early on, this is fine. Later on, as you need more and more XP, these get very scarce.Early on, the game is easy, and so you play the game for fun. You put points into whatever skills sound fun and work. At this point, the game is good.Later on, however, there is a huge difficulty spike. And you can't predict it. The game doesn't slowly change the challenges it throws at you. So you keep building a character that works, until it suddenly doesn't. When it doesn't, you can't really change your build. At least not without grind.Since you can't respec your character, you're largely at the mercy of what the game decides to throw at you. The skills also scale terribly, and later skills are almost necessary since they're much better than early skills (regardless of your gear or how many points you put into them).The lack of respec is the biggest issue, to me. You can't really experiment with different skills.Which is why you have so many people \"min-maxing\" and going online in search for the \"optimal build\". The game doesn't really give you a chance to respond to a challenge, forcing you to make the correct choice from the start.(3) Again, the game is pure filler.This has two main aspects. The first is that you have essentially the same dungeon (with minor map variations) 4 times, plus the boss. The second is that the skill tree has 10 points to put into each skill/passive.The result, to me, is a game that is stretched beyond what is interesting. The repeated floors are there to let you earn enough XP to get those 10 points per skill, or vice-versa. Coupled with the lack of respec, this is a surprising problem. Because each class can be played in different ways. And there are 3 different classes. So why not have a shorter game that encourages experimentation with different specializations or classes? Why stretch a single game for so long, and prevent you from trying different playstyles?___Anyway. I honestly find the game very bad. I didn't enjoy Diablo II either, for largely the same reasons (2 and 3, mostly; 1 is also present, but in a less direct way).Perhaps the online component and the status of rare items changes the context of the dungeoneering/filler. Even then, however, the game becomes a slot machine, in my opinion.Although this is likely to be an unpopular opinion, I feel like ARPGs (at least traditional ones like Diablo and Torchlight) would benefit immensely from the modern Roguelite structure. It's a lot about making the main dungeoneering loop more interesting by presenting a lot more choices and ways to exploit the random nature of the loot.Since you also use a small number of skills, even the combat could be probably changes to a more MOBA-like style, like Battlerite. But maybe this is blasphemy. Anyway. If you like Diablo, you should like this. It's the same game, minus the incredible atmosphere of the former.I guess I don't.",

        "text": "Figment is really good in just about every aspect, except for the gameplay, which is mediocre at best.The first thing to standout is the music. It's a semi-musical, with bosses singing along with cheesy lyrics. It's cooler than it sounds! Although I have to admit it made me cheer for the bad guys, whose themes are a million times better than the \"good\" theme near the end. The instrumentation also fits the environmental objects you see, and it's all synchronized, even some sound effects. So really no complaints there, everything fits together very nicely.Something else you may enjoy is the dense symbolism, some of it subtle, some of it in your face. But there's a lot of it, and across many of the game's aspects. From the music to the environments, to the narrative. Everything is strongly connected in a way you don't see in many games. If you enjoy spotting all of those details ALONE, you will probably enjoy the game.The story itself, and its themes aren't very deep. I would say it is mostly about the loss of childlike wonder (and creativity - whether musical or mathematical, in the game) in adulthood, and its replacement with bureaucracy, bills, etc.. But the way they present it, as I said above regarding symbolism, can be very cool and subtle. I suppose it's a case of \"rhetoric\" - they eloquently deliver the message, but the value of the message leaves a bit to be desired.Now comes the problematic part: the gameplay. There are three aspects to this:70% of the game is about collecting coloured batteries which you can then open coloured doors with. This could lead to interesting puzzles, but no. The way they designed the levels was extremely tedious - you need to use battery A to open a path to battery B. You then go back and remove battery A to use it somewhere else to collect battery C. You then use batteries B and C to collect battery D. And so on and so forth. These aren't really puzzles, but merely \"mazes\". There is little of interest in this section and you're really just opening and closing paths to progress in the story.20% of the game is slightly more interesting, but still insufficient. These are real puzzles. The problem is that they are rather few, and they're also too varied - by which I mean there are maybe 4 or 5 puzzles of one kind, and then 4 or 5 of a completely different kind. It's impossible to build up complexity or add interesting mechanics to the basic setup like this. I remember 4 types of puzzles: (1) pushing/pulling blocks, (2) pushing blocks until they hit a wall, typically with two blocks, (3) remembering a path in a grid which you have to retrace, almost like Simon Says, and (4) variation on Hamiltonian path (visit every cell of a grid exactly once - the variation, here, is that you visit only an odd number of times. (1) and (2) are good foundations for puzzles, but, as I said, there is barely any build-up in complexity, and so they're rather disappointing. (3) is just memory, little to figure out. (4) is the most interesting one, potentially, given that there are many variations of the basic mechanics that lead to interesting puzzles. However, besides the lack of build-up, they've chosen one of the few wrong variations that are trivial to solve. In fact, the path you choose is completely irrelevant, since walking back and forth will let you find a solution. There is a deeper point to be made if you know basic computer science, but I won't get into it. Suffice it to say that they've completely missed the mark on this one.The last 10% are extra memories. These are more or less hidden, and the puzzles aren't standard. Some rely on you saving some extra coloured batteries, some are like mini quests, having you go around knocking on some doors, others are about knocking on some doors in a special sequence, etc. These are a cool addition, but they're not the meat of the game. It's also easy to miss and revisiting levels is very tedious because of the whole battery switching back and forth I've mentioned earlier. I enjoyed looking for them the first time around, but I couldn't bother to actually go back for the 3 or 4 ones I've missed.Ok, to conclude. I would NOT really recommend the game. The gameplay was not interesting in the least, and the message, while not completely worthless, isn't anything to write home about either. But the game has enough attention to detail and some surprising details that justify its existence, at least. It's not a completely throwaway game that offers nothing new. It DOES have something going for it, so I'd say give it a go IF you know the gameplay will be uninspired.",

        "text": "This is a really solid game.It was actually hesitant to play it, simply because I have so many games, and I don't really like the way it looks. It doesn't look terrible, but doesn't really look particularly good either. And it doesn't really evoke the gritty cyberpunk feeling. Still, after playing Tokyo 42, I decided to give it a shot, since I had some top-down shooter momentum. And I'm glad I did.Surprisingly, some of the aspects I most like are also aspects that people seem to take issue with. So let's go over them.One common argument is that it looks exactly like Neon Chrome, their previous game. Well, what happens is that they developed a top-down shooter engine to reuse in different games. But, since the most basic gameplay (top-down shooting) and the theme are the same, people jump to the conclusion that the games will be very similar - really, it's an easy, heuristical, substitution to look at base gameplay and visuals, in about 5 seconds, instead of playing the game for an hour before judging.The games are very different. Neon Chrome is a rogue-like, a game more about endurance and random upgrades. JYDGE is a game about short challenges and studying levels. It isn't quite a stealth game, but has many elements from stealth too.There are two great things about this game: level variety and customization. There are 18 fairly short levels in the game. Each level is available in 4 different difficulties. Each of these also has 3 different objectives. And this is where the game shines, to me. In my Tokyo 42 review I complained about how every mission encouraged exactly the same kind of gameplay - kill everyone undetected. JYDGE is very very different. The 3 objectives are always different in each level AND difficulty. They go from being undetected, killing everyone, saving every hostage, not destroying walls, killing certain targets in under X time, collecting every money case, etc. etc. Some of them can be annoying or frustrating, but most of them are doable and enjoyable. They also show you each level in many different ways!This, unfortunately, is another common complaint. Levels are gated by the number of medals you have, which means you may be \"forced\" to replay some levels, at least in different difficulties, to unlock later levels. To be clear, you never need to collect every medal to unlock levels.This complaint actually bothers me a bit. There is some psychological element to it. Replaying levels on different difficulties is actually a very different experience. The actions you take are completely different. But, somehow, having it labeled as \"same level, higher difficulty\" makes one think that this is \"cheap\" or \"lazy\" while it is nothing of the sort.Anyway. If you play the game, take this into account. You're not trying to \"unlock every level\" or \"beat the last level once\". This game is about going back and forth through most levels, replaying them in different difficulties and figuring out how to meet each objective.Which leads into the second great thing about the game - the amount of customization. This is what makes the whole medal hunting work. There are many different weapons and, especially, modifiers. Things like making you invisible in the dark, or while stationary for the stealth missions. Things like a shield preventing X damage to meet the \"untouchable\" objective. Or moving much faster, but having no HP to complete the time trials. There are several game changing perks you can choose from, and part of the fun is also figuring out which to use for each different mission.These are also unlocked as you gain more medals, which creates a positive feedback loop where you're buying some perks to gain a medal, which gives you a different perk for you to try on other medals, etc. etc. It also means you don't get stuck on any particular medal or level for a long time - at least not until the very end, if you're trying to go for 100% completion (which is not at all required for unlocking all the levels).The only complaint I have in this regard is that there are weapon upgrades (damage up, only). Missions earn you money, with which you can buy upgrades and perks, after you unlock them with medals. But weapons upgrades are merely just money sinks. They're filler. And the thing is that they're (almost) necessary to meet some medals. Story-wise, I didn't really care much about it. You get a custscene after each Act, of four. There isn't much story.The music is alright, being a mix of rock and electronic. There are many tracks, which is good when you're sometimes obsessively retrying levels. But the music itself wasn't amazing. It fit the theme, but, like the visuals, didn't really reach anywhere near the peak of this kind of aesthetic. Still, not bad.The meat of the game is really in going back and forward, trying levels under different requirements, with different game changing perks, and slowly making progress. I find many of the common complaints to be really misguided - more psychological artifacts than real design issues.Also, to conclude, I'd also say something about the achievements - another psychological artifact, perhaps.The game only awards achievements for completing all three medals on every level for each difficulty. This is too coarse-grained, to me. On each difficulty, there are 18*3=54 medals. The achievements place people who earned 3 medals on the same bucket as the people who earned 50 medals. The only complaint here is that this structure will probably discourage people to go for medals, unless they're hardcore completionists. I understand that achievements have a bad reputation, and achievements alone shouldn't give you a reason to do anything. That said, achievements are widespread, and should thus be used as best as possible! And I think players, myself included, would be more encouraged to collect as many medals as possible if there were achievements like \"get X medals\" every 5 or 10 medals or whatever.That should be enough. I really enjoyed this game. It's very mechanically focused, but it's also worth your time, if you're into top-down shooters. 10tons have a lot of experience in the genre and have put it to good use, here!",

        "text": "This game is a perfect example of a stubborn (although beautiful) decision can ruin a potentially very good game.To get it out of the way, the game's main problem is the combination of the isometric perspective and the bullet-hell style combat and verticality. It's neither alone that provides a problem, but the combination is really bad.The second main problem is that the game is otherwise extremely barebones with underdeveloped mechanics across the board. There are also camera related bugs, since, when you turn the camera, your weapons are suddenly pointed elsewhere and so are the controls. In most situations this is fine, but not in others - which puts the rotten cherry on top of an already incredibly frustrating game.Starting with the camera, which is an almost universal problem people have with this game. While the isometric view is very stylish, and they use it to create a really amazing world, it is a terrible view if you want to locate objects in space. There's a reason why Escher used it in his Waterfall (from Penrose's triangle), and the same reason Monument Valley uses it. It is ambiguous, and thus prone to illusions, since it makes your brain think objects are placed in one way when they are not.Perspective camera has its problems too, but a few million years of evolution made us pretty good at it.This alone isn't the problem. The problem is that they've built a 3D world. There are many action shooters with an isometric perspective (stuff like Alien/Zombie Shooter), a really great modern version of which is Brigador! But those games are almost \"reskins\" of top-down shooters. They're played on a 2D plane, and so the perspective becomes merely aesthetic.In here, it doesn't. And when you have to jump around, or have bullets coming from all sides, including above, everything comes crumbling down.This could all be helped with additional markers (like projecting bullets and grenades on the ground, as they do with the player), but that wouldn't be \"hardcore\" enough, I suppose. So we're left with a broken game instead.To make matters worse, the developers really, really insisted on having fast-paced and precision requiring gameplay. Side-missions include timed platforming challenges and flying around in a motorcycle (with some of the worst controls I've seen). It's this that I don't understand with so many gameplay possibilities, many consistent with this kind of view, the developers kept pushing the precise and fast-paced style that the isometric view is terrible for.And here's the thing: below the badly designed action part of the game, this is great! I don't just mean the artstyle. The music is great, sometimes amazing. The more exploratory \"secrets\" are really cool, sometimes involving platforming that makes you play around with the camera carefully and revealing surprising paths through levels. There is also a \"tourist\" challenge where you can mark some NPCs in interesting situations hidden around the world. Some are about pressing or shooting switches in a certain order to unlock a door. On their own, I guess none of these elements sound very interesting, but they are much better when they're carefully built into the open world, and encourage you to look at every scene from multiple angles. The platforming can also be quite satisfying, since you jump pretty high and can then reach far places.But all these things that make this game unique are seemingly thrown into the corner in favor of a bad action game.Most of the missions can also be approach with stealth. This could have worked, but the stealth mechanics are very underdeveloped, and becomes extremely tedious in the following context: every mission has 3 optional objectives; these are (1) kill everyone (2) never be detected (3) do 1 and 2 together. Every mission has these objectives. (except missions which don't have optional objectives at all). And so the game encourages you to play every mission in exactly the same way. And, as I said, the mechanics aren't up to snuff. The stealth mechanics boil down to line of sight, crouching, and patrols. You will be detected if you stay for more than 1 second within line of sight of a guard. However, these guards don't actually follow you with their eyes, nah - you can just walk around them and be fine. Also, while the game has multiple weapon variations, these are rather redundant, as the only trait that is relevant is noise, which is either buggy or very counter intuitive. This is because guards don't get alerted by the shooting of the game, but by when the bullet hits a body. And you can be pretty far away and still be detected - unless you have a quiet gun, which I don't even know how to quantify that; all I know is that one secret sniper rifle I've found could kill everyone silently from almost any distance, while all other weapons would alert guards from infinitely far away.There is no way to distract guards. Disguising yourself is barely a thing, only really used to maybe cross a small path of a level.I played mostly stealthily. But not because it was fun - simply because I really, really didn't want to mess around with the terrible bullet hell side of the game.The last mission, suprise surprise, have you fighting in a small room (although with cover) against 5 waves of enemies - throwing you back to the start if you die (which happens with a single stray bullet that you can't even see where it came from). At this point, I thought that enough is enough.The world is really beautiful. They've totally nailed the aesthetic, and the music sounds really good, especially in the temples and near the end of the game.But there are abismal design decisions and the implementation isn't great either (with important bugs that further hinder combat).If you're willing to withstand a great deal of frustration, you may be able to get used to the game and get to enjoy it. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. There are good, great little touches here, but the sweeping strokes ruin the whole, for me. ",

        "text": "Caravan is so close to a really cool game, but it shows all of its cards on the first 3 or 4 hours, and then it only loses steam from there, never picking up again.First off, I've been reading the Thousand Nights and a Night, which is the main reason I picked this game up. The idea of a traveling and trading game has also been on my mind since I've played Jalopy.I was actually very excited when I started playing, since the game does a lot of things right. Unfortunately, they are rather superficial, and the game meanders for more than half of its length (it took me 10 hours to 100%).The best thing about it is the theme. Everything here is very well made, with the mechanics being clearly inspired by real caravans and being fairly original. Visually, the game is surprisingly good, which I didn't expect from the screenshots - the game looks much better in motion. And the screenshots are pretty bad, especially when the game has really great colors, something not shown in the foggy example images.The music is also pretty good, and fitting, using a Duduk (an oriental flute) to great effect. The bad thing about it is that there is a single track for maybe 80% of your time. This gets rather monotonous quickly.Mechanically, the game started off very interesting, since you have to figure out how the game's economy works. This involves apparently tedious work (like writing prices down, trying to understand when changes in price happen, etc.) but I enjoy the process of understanding the system from whatever partial information you get. Unfortunately, this soon reveals pointless - all you really need to do is sell the highest priced items (Jewelry) at the cheaper towns  and sell them at the more expensive ones. Low valued items like food or raw materials don't really give you much profit, even you manage to get a \"great deal\". If you have an item valued 5 and sell it at double the price, you get 5 of profit. If you have an item valued 50, to get a profit of 5, you only need to sell it 10% higher. You get the idea.Then, there's the actual travelling. This is something that is badly designed, unfortunately. While you have a party of characters with different classes and skills, some of which are designed to help travel, you have to manage water, and you can have \"lesser companions\" (like slaves (called \"auxiliars\") and animals) that modify travel resources, these are almost entirely irrelevant. You simply don't need to pay any attention to these skills to get through the game. Moreover, it's actually quite tedious to have to activate the same skills over and over once the cooldown ends.The random events, similarly, provide only a marginal benefit, and there are very few of them, and each has maybe 3 or 4 outcomes at most, which means you start seeing the same results after the first 3 or 4 hours. This is very unfortunate, since it makes the travelling very monotonous, and you're better off ignoring events altogether (your time, in real life, is valuable!).These are perhaps useful at the start of the game, when you have low inventory and water capacity, your characters are low leveled, etc. Once you get through this portion of the game, however, a lot of the mechanics become obsolete and you're better off ignoring them.One other important aspect is combat and haggling. Both of these use of the same, which is surprisingly interesting an unique! Combat and Haggling use a different set of stats, but they work in the same way. There are 3 stats in a Rock-Paper-Scissors like manner. They beat each other in a circular way. The system itself works with dicerolls as well as stats. It's 1-on-1, and each starts with their base stats. Your Rock attacks their Scissors, their Scissors attacks your Paper, your Paper attacks their Rock, their Rock... etc. They all attack at once. If your Attack larger than their Defense (for each pair), you do damage equal to that different. Dice are rolled, each with different colors, corresponding to Rock, Paper, Scissors, or a white die that you can apply to whatever stat you want. There are several rounds, until someone's HP reaches 0. Once the dice are rolled, each player picks one to increase their stat (according to the number rolled). Perhaps a video can explain this better. It reminds me of a game by Terry Cavanagh called \"Grab Them by the Eyes\". It's interesting because, by choosing one die, you are increasing your stat, and also preventing your opponent from picking this die. And, at the same time, you are \"foregoing\" other dice on the field that your opponent can pick up.I find this really interesting! Unfortunately, it has 2 big problems. One problem is that it suffers from the same problem as many JRPGs which I'll call \"battle fatigue\". The combat system may be interesting, but it is so frequent, and the strategy so similar from one battle to another that it becomes a chore. The other problem is that the AI is terrible - it simply chooses their die at random, I'm fairly certain. This means that the combat becomes pretty easy and not interesting at all (since there's isn't nearly as much of a risk between two choices - chances are your opponent will pick low values while you pick the high values). The repetition and lack of a good AI makes the combat very tedious once you understand the rules. Especially when you level up your character and have to go through the whole song and dance against characters with such low stats that they have no chance of beating you. There should be an \"auto-battle\" mode where you both pick dice at random or something. Higher risk, but at least it would save time.The final point I want to mention, and it is a huge missed opportunity in my eyes, is the writing.If you're read anything from the time in which the game \"should be\" set (the time of the Nights, so between 800 and 1200, probably) you'll know that the persian literature was extremely poetic and full of theatrics and metaphors. This is very apparent in the Nights, but even scientific works were mostly written in verse! Or, if in prose, still in very lyrical language.Unfortunately, the game doesn't use any of this writing style in the game. Given the thematic importance of the rest of the game, this is a big miss.Then, even the story is extremely barebones and not very relevant at all. The quests aren't interesting at all, and while they use symbols of the Nights (like Jinn and the important kings), they take it in a much more generic direction. The Jinn are merely generic bad guys. In this regard, I feel like the game would be amazing if written by the Sunless Sea team. The writing is one of the elements that could make this game really amazing, and compensate for all the other problems.A minor writing nitpick is that, at some point, Romans appear. I have no idea why? They seem, to me, to be completely distinct periods. Maybe I missed some important point in the writing.Ok, one last point I want to make. The cities in the game are really nice! Although rather simple, they seem to follow the architecture of the respective cities fairly faithfully in style! And they look very good, so they deserve some credit there!Anyway. The game has a very strong start, but it doesn't have enough content or complexity to justify its full length. The second half of the game (once you understand the systems) is extremely tedious, since you can merely mainline the quest and the trading with safety, without strong writing to keep the interest up.",

        "text": "Wheels of Aurelia was really disappointing, to me. My excitement was fairly low at the start (mostly being confused about the game's structure), then it rose once I understood how the game worked (in terms of the branching narrative), and then it slowly sank to its lowest point (where it stayed) due to the monotony of the game's first half.I'll state the conclusion right away: the game has a great concept, but it seems that they've left it at that. While the idea is really cool, it seems like they didn't attempt to solve any of the design problems that appeared along the way. This leads to you playing the same sections of the game over and over and over again, hoping to find the right dialogue choice that leads to a new ending. The beginning of the game, however, is always the same (and you can't speak, because early choices determine which choices appear later). Exact same path, exact same dialogue. This becomes extremely tedious.The game fits right into the games I've played recently: Jalopy on one hand, and Mooseman and Never Alone on the other. Like Jalopy, the gameplay is about mudane driving, with a narrative background. Like Mooseman, it is a game about culture, in this case 1978 Italy.In Jalopy, I complained how the driving was extremely empty, since the \"Uncle\" character never spoke to you. This games is the exact opposite! You find different people, with whom you're constantly engaged in conversation. The other problems remain, however - the driving isn't engaging at all (here even less than Jalopy!) and the landscape isn't something to marvel at either. In Aurelia, this leaves the dialogue - which could be good, but the narrative design ends up ruining things, for me.The game's roadmap is essentially a graph with cities A, B1, B2, C1, C2, D. A is connected to B1 and B2. B1 and B2 are connected to C1 and C2. C1 and C2 are connected to D, where the game ends. You always start with the same companion, which you can leave and switch for another at B or C. There are also events - races - at these points. Other than that, you may pick up some hitchhikers along any path, although these are also the same for each path, and offer little in terms of dialogue (although they connect to the main story at certain points, which is nice, but is a nice addition that does nothing to save the main loop).The game has 16 endings which are merely permutations of these paths and decisions. The problem with this is that there is a lot of shared dialogue. Moreover, it isn't even clear which action leads to a different ending, with some different actions leading to the exact same dialogue with only a couple of different lines.This, in the end, made the game very tedious to me, making me stop after discovering 6 of the 16 endings. Some of the endings are reached by unclear dialogue choices with the hitchhikers, while others are reached to winning a race with different cars, or losing the same race, etc. But the gameplay itself is largely the same! You're doing the same things over and over, with some minute change. This isn't enough, in my opinion.The driving itself is also extremely basic: the car drives alone, slowly; if you want, you can accelerate, at which point you're have to manually turn. That's it. You can only accelerate and turn left/right. Bumping into cars or walls is meaningless - you'll hear a bump of a honk, but nothing really changes. You don't manage fuel, car damage, nothing. The different cars are also all the same (except visually), perhaps with different velocity and acceleration, which, given the basic gameplay is also irrelevant.Now, the writing. This is the point about which I'm most ambivalent. It's cool that the developers are presenting a particular era of Italy, one of fascism, communism, rebelion, freedom, etc. but it presents things in a kind of \"fake intellectualism\", where the game doesn't actually say anything meaningful, but instead points to important historical movements or events and mostly leaves it at that. If one wants to write about the game, one could probably write a complex thesis about all of the themes because, well, they existed and were complex. But there's little in the game itself to justify it. Moreover, the game leaves you with a \"Wheelopedia\" about all those events in the form of Wikipedia excerpts... I mean, you made a game about these events, supposedly, shouldn't you write specifically about your views and how they relate to the game?It may resonate much more strongly with people who are familiar or interested with this historical niche of 70s Italy. For other people, however, I doubt there is much value, here. I don't see how the themes related to the gameplay at all. Maybe it's just a historical window? Giving you a glimpse of this period while you drive around? But even if so, the forced repetition of the dialogue doesn't help. And it's not a game I would play at my leisure, simply driving around looking at the scenery - because this aspect is extremely underdeveloped!Enough ranting. I didn't get much out of the writing. Maybe other people will, and it may save the game - maybe.Only some final remarks about the visual style and the music.The visuals are nice - certainly pretty! - but are a bit too iconic. Most of the buildings look the same (although there was some effort to model and color different cities differently - but the game's style is too minimalist to make them really stand out, in my eyes) and their placement seemed rather random. You can get gas stations every 20 meters, and several of the same house next to each other. The minimalist style also prevents me from just looking at the buildings while driving, since it all starts looking the same. It's a cute background, but never something where you can set your attention - which I find is one of the biggest potential in a game about mundane driving! Just looking around, sometimes...The music is good, but also rather sparse. There are maybe 5 or 6 tracks overall? And they're not very long, either. They sound great, but they're also rather iconic. They're short and seem intended to give you an idea of what Italian prog-rock sounded like without going to the trouble of letting you listen to real albums. The song of the trailer is, by far, the most developed song in the whole game, and it plays only in the menu and trailer.So, to conclude. For a mundane driving game, it still doesn't solve the major problems. Like Jalopy, it doesn't take advantage of the mundane elements to let the player enjoy the music or the scenery. Instead, it focus on the narrative, which could be fine, but is torn down by the monotony (like this review, probably!).",

        "text": "It's a cool little game if you want to learn about a different culture rather than play a good game.It's very similar to The Mooseman, actually. In both games, you're playing a mythological journey that is very light on actual gameplay, while collecting bits of information about the mythology and people behind the journey.There are some puzzle and platforming elements, but they're not really the focus of the game, and aren't challenging.From time to time, you will gain a new video, which is almost like a documentary fragment about one of the people of Alaska. The biggest difference between Mooseman and Never Alone is that the former is about a past culture (with archaeological evidence from the 7th-9th centuries), while the latter is about a still living community - although they are largely modernised by now, and the game is an attempt to \"preserve\" (although that isn't really a good word - perhaps \"present\" is more appropriate) their older traditions and values.One very interesting aspect of these videos is how they tie the mythological journey with the rather mundane adventures of the people speaking, or their close ancestors (parents, grandparents at most). There was one particular story - about father and two sons being lost adrift in a piece of ice calling 911 (yeah, not very poetic!) and having a few hiccups but being ultimately saved. This is used in the game, where you're also lost adrift - although it is given a more poetic treatment and added to the overall \"myth\". This happens at several points - the videos either elaborate on something you see in the game (like the children spirits of the aurora borealis, or the context of hunting in the community), or provides a justification for it (like the drifting story).It makes me wonder whether mythology itself may be created from these more mudane stories of multiple people into a single hero to represent them. Probably an element. Either way, this was a cool aspect!The music isn't very traditional, which is unfortunate, but it still worked very well within the game and created a great atmosphere.The graphics are cool as well, although they're tricky. Most of the background is blurry, so it could be rather unimpressive. Still, they manage to play with the colors in a great way, especially with the aurora and the underwater effects. Not the best looking game out there, but I found it surprisingly nice.Finally, some of the scenes in the videos are really great and so are the colors.Not much to say about gameplay. It's slow, and the DLC, which focused a bit more on gameplay and puzzles was rather tedious. Still, I had heard bad things about the companion AI in the game - I didn't have many problems. It's an okay game, although nothing worth playing for its mechanical strength of artistry alone. But the culture behind it surely makes up for it, and, as I said, they've managed to combine the game's journey with the videos presented in a very nice way that makes it worth playing!",

There are some \"secrets\" you can look far, but they are very short deviations from the otherwise linear path. However, the game has mythological passages spread around. The writing on these actually reminds me of early Lord Dunsany's writings! Anyway. These passages are also related to the journey you're going through in the game. The secrets you find provides imagery from actual archaeological finds, with short descriptions.That's about it. Although not stunning, visually, it has some nice scenes, and the music is also used very well in those!The gameplay is the poorer aspect, given how simple it really is (and the animations are very crude, too). Regardless, I think it's a very cool way of presenting the mythology of a culture!",

        "text": "The idea of this game is great. The execution, however, is not. And I can't fathom how this game has \"Mostly Positive\" reviews given the amount of bugs and even the fact that the game is not finished (smuggling, which seems important given the game's dialogue, is not even implemented in any relevant way).There are a few games that take the idea of casual driving (ignoring the simulators) like HitchHikers, GlitchHiker, and Wheels of Aurelia. This is another addition to the \"genre\", if I can call it that.The game is supposed to be you driving with your uncle out of Germany into Turkey through Soviet lands. The setting could be really cool - but then nothing is really done with it. In fact, the game is simply filler, and a carrot at the end of the stick - which you will never reach, but, again, the game isn't really finished.The \"game\" is an excuse for a 1-page story bit you get at each stop point of your journey, of which there are maybe 8 (at most) in the whole game. That's it. And it's not a brilliant story at all. It can barely be called a story. Somehow, I've read about people reacting very emotionally to the ending (spoilers: your uncle leaves at the end of the journey). I'm incapable of understanding this, given that this uncle character is with you the whole time but barely talks to you, excepting the ocasional meaningless remarks \"oh, this country is so beautiful\" or \"oh, it's been so long since I've been here\" or other tutorial-like messages (that invariably come far too late to be of use anyway).The gameplay, too, isn't any good. The makings of a good loop are present, but the large amount of bugs, terrible interface design, opaqueness of the rules and generally incomplete state of the game make that potential mute.The way to make money is simply to grab crates you find on the road. There isn't any point to buying stuff at the towns to sell at another (perhaps with the exception of alcohol at a discount, since it is the most expensive supply), since most things are too cheap, and you'll find them on the road anyway.Smuggling, which was supposed to be the main \"trading\" mechanic - trying to buy forbidden supply where you're at to sell at a high price in the next town - isn't actually implemented. Or, if it is, it is terribly implemented, since the smuggling price bonus is negligible, and there isn't much skill in it. At the border, there's a random chance you're going to be searched. That's about it. But again, it's pointless if you don't gain much from it.There's the upgrade system - buying parts. These, however, are so expensive, that you won't really get a chance to buy anything worthwhile - unless you're lucky to find alcohol in the road, which you can sell high. Most of the parts you'll find come from cars abandoned along the road.Anyway.The biggest problem is that the driving itself is lengthy and extremely empty. And this is the part of the game with most potential! Since you're driving with your uncle, there's a lot of room for his life stories, or whatever, but he barely talks. There's also a lot of potential in using the radio to let the player get a taste for eastern european music, in all its forms - instead, you get maybe 3 or 4 extremely basic \"tracks\" that loop very monotonously, and aren't really well developed pieces of music at all.The world is also incredibly foggy and muddy - not sure if this is atmosphere, or simply a way to hide the lack of actual work put into the graphics. Nights are also much longer than days (again, low visibility). The screenshots are cherry-picked and not at all representative of what you'll see for 70-80% of the time.Finally, the tutorial is really terrible. The first time, I played for 2 or 3 hours, and was having a hell of a time. Nothing was working, I had no money and the car was all broken. Still, I managed to learn what I was actually supposed to do and restarted. The second playthrough was extremely empty and boring, since, having learned the mechanics, that game is pretty uneventful.It's structured almost like a rogue-like, where you pick a destination, choosing between weather and road conditions, as well as length (waste more fuel and repairs, but find more stuff on the road). But, where a rogue-like is designed for multiple playthroughs and interacting systems, this game is \"designed\" for a single playthrough, and so it stops at \"learn the systems\", which don't interact in any interesting way.I don't know. People seem to enjoy it. I see a lot of potential, but find the execution terrible.The game's redeeming quality is the texturing on your uncle's jacket - it's a simple trick, but it looks cool.",

I doubt this game will stick on my mind at all now that I've finished it.Only a few notes about the game.You basically fly around the world having to grab some special items from special places to carry the story forward. Nothing really noteworthy about its structure, it doesn't do much there.The most important aspect of the game, gameplay-wise, is probably the flyind. Does it feel any good?Well, yes and no. Unfortunately, the no is much more frequent than the yes.The flying animation is great, by the way. Now, the thing about flying that you probably want, is a sense of speed. The game does that beautifully if you fly close to the islands, between trees, rocks, etc. The problem is that, most of the time, you'll be flying between islands, or far enough away that you can look at things from up eye. Hawkeye exists for a reason - if you want to find prey, you do it from above. In this case, you're looking for certain pages of lore, or memories of people, whatever - the point is that the islands only exist to hold these things, and you'll find them easier from above than walking around. And speeding past trees and trying hard to avoid collisions is not a good task to do while scouting.So far, the flying is good, but very rare. How is flying from above and between islands, then? Well, very boring. The problem is that you're flying at a high speed, but between very large and far apart things, and so you don't actual get a good sense of motion or speed. Furthermore, the camera zooms back a lot, which doesn't help the sense of speed.The game has some (random, I think? Except for tunneling zones) wind currents, but they're very far apart and only serve to give you a small speed boost that quickly goes away. They also serve only as a boost, never as something to avoid. Riding the wind is rather limited to touching a rare white curve in the air, unfortunately.So yeah. Overall, it's not as great as it could be. They've put in the work to make flying fun, but only in the \"wrong\" and rare occasions. Oops.Gameplay-wise, there are some \"puzzles\" (rotate shape A until it matches shape B or go around and open doors to find a button to open another door) and platforming. The platforming isn't very good for two reasons: one is that the walking and collision is sometimes iffy when the terrain is tilted; the other is that the player character doesn't conserve velocity in moving platforms - you'd except to keep moving with the speed you had before jumping from a moving platform, but all that is gone, making things rather awkward. These are not very important complaints, though. Platforming is only done in a few sections and isn't really the focus. It's extremely basic, and seems to be a way out if people call it a non-game.Ok, nothing much gameplay-wise.Is the story any good? Heh.I like the background story, but it's extremely thin. It's basically about a creation myth involving primal animals, an evil tyrant king, and a messiah. It's somewhat nice, but you get maybe 20 pieces of short text, lore-wise. And they're spread throughout the world. So, again, it's very thin. It's little more than flavor text. It's well done, but not very substantial. Especially the tyrant king thing, it's doesn't really do much more than \"this guy is very evil\".So, again, \"heh\". I'm leaving it as a recommendation because the visual style is really good, and so is the music, making for great atmosphere (I dislike the flying music, though, having a guitar and a banjo seems very out of place). The architecture especially is really good. It's blocky and full of straightlines, but it is detailed at the same time. It plays very nicely with the shadows.The story is okay, but it never becomes really meaningful. Good flavor-text, but still flavor-text (at least I feel like it was, anyway).Falls short of what it could have been, but it is more than competent in some areas, so I'll say \"go for it\" if it seems your thing. But don't expect it to be revolutionary.Edit: If you're expecting something like Journey or ABZU, don't. The game isn't made of structured setpieces. The islands change flavor or mood a bit, but that's about it. You fly around freely, finding pieces of the story or lore spread around, while sometimes entering temples to progress the story.",

        "text": "This is not good at all.From a story perspective, there isn't really anything. There's nothing beyond \"we're the good guys fighting against the bad guys\" in any way.The combat also has barely any strategy involved. You basically move units within range and attack. Special abilities have little relevance. There's no cover, terrain, positioning, anything, really. You have some abilities but, again, they're not very relevant to winning any battle. The game is extremely easy - if you have some problem, try another battle to gain gold to upgrade your units.The map is basically a line with a few small branches (usually a battle and a shop of some kind). There is no reason to try one over another, though. You just visit them all (dumbly) and that's that.Upgrades and equipment are really just a gold sink. You buy units (to upgrade) as you gain gold from battles, but, again, there are no choices. There aren't different builds for you to try. The planning exists to the extent that each unit type costs different amounts of gold, and so you can prioritize some over others. But, again, it makes very little difference.The game works, but I can't imagine anyone getting a valuable experience out of this. It has an extremely basic skeleton all of the filler without any of special details that make a game worth playing. Oh well.",

        "text": "It's good!But it has big balance and structure problems.Just to get an idea about the game, it's almost like a mini-roguelike. Each run lasts maybe 10-15 minutes, making a \"quest\". Once you complete a quest, you'll unlock more quests in a deterministic way. Your job is to complete every quest. Each quest earns you gold that you can spend on upgrades. Dying only resets the progress for that particular quest, not the whole game. Upgrades include new character classes and unlocking equipment (which you have a chance of finding during a quest).The mechanics are very cool! During a quest, you get some cards each turn. These cards can be gold, enemies and tiles. Tiles have connectivity properties that determine where you can place them. The map starts with a few fixed tiles, and you must place others to guide your character. The character is attracted by gold and enemies, and you have to place them in a specific way if you want to use specific paths, etc.You character always starts at level 1 in each quest. Defeating a monster of your level (or higher) will make you level up, so you'll want to keep beating stronger monsters. Equipment also comes in different \"levels\", and monster of level N drop equipment of level N. Each time you kill a monster, you'll get a number of equipment choices, but you can only choose one. This should be enough to give you an idea.The combat itself is almost like Slay the Spire, or Monster Slayers. You have a deck (determined by character class and equipment), and so does your opponent. The first thing to note is the asymmetry of combat. Enemies attack first (unless you use certain cards), and if you both die on the same turn, you lose. This puts you at a disadvantage. However, you can see what card your opponent will play (unless, again, he uses a specific card), so you can respond to his play, putting you at an advantageous position!There are no combos, really. Each turn you play only one card. You hand isn't discarded, so you'll have the same cards in subsequent turns (except for the one you played and the one you draw). The problem with this is that character classes matter little in determining your equipment. There are few synergies, so you tend to build similar decks with every character, since each move is the one that *best responds to the opponent* (independent of your class).The third tier of classes have an additional perk that may synergize with specific cards, though, so there is differentiation in classes, it simply comes late (too late, as I'll argue).The equipment is actually very interesting, but I didn't know how it worked until very late in the game, for some reason. Basically, each piece of gear has an attribute (like Arcane I, Blade II, etc.). And attributes stack in different pieces of equipment. So, if you have an Arcane I sword and an Arcane II helmet, your character has the cards of Arcane III tier. I never noticed this! Instead, I was choosing equipment based on the information they give (you lose cards x, y and you gain cards z, w from replacing one piece of gear with the other). So basically I was using a greedy strategy and ignoring future equipment. This is partially an interface problem and partially my own lack of attention in the tutorial, maybe? Anyway. It's an interesting mechanic!One important thing to realize is that the game has a fairly high degree of chance (but it is not \"pure rng\" as some other players claim). You can often die in the first battle, before having a chance of getting gear at all. But this is fine, as long and you take it as a probabilistic game. Since quests are very short, you get right back into the game. If you play well, you'll maximize your chances of winning, it's as simply as that.Now, the biggest balance problem is you can't really beat the game with the starting classes (at least reliably). Monsters get stronger in later quests, and beating your first battle seems impossible with the weaker characters. This makes buying the later classes too important, to me. It also tends to make you choose only one or two classes to play. (I'd say single class, but your characters take one quest to respawn, so you'll be alternating between two). Having to buy classes (instead of unlocking loot) was also discouraging, to me. So I'd buy a single class of each tier, at least until I had unlocked all of the loot.This aspect of the game could use some work. Maybe work on the respawning mechanic. Instead of respawning dead characters after a single quest, maybe have an additional system of chance, maybe with upgrades to guide player choice, I don't know. But it doesn't work very well as is.The second huge balance problem is that the third tier classes are incredibly overpowered (or at least the one I played the most). You can gain full control of the game very quickly. I could draw the whole deck into my hand, heal infinitely high and build infinitely strong attacks against pretty much every enemy. And I did this reliably on the last quests. The game starts quite difficult, but the difficulty drops pretty quickly once you unlock classes until it becomes almost trivial.I've probably written enough. There are some minor mechanics I didn't mention, but I think I've touched on the most important topics.The visual style is cool, and the music even more so (although it does become repetitive later on - I disabled it and ran the game at 5x speed once it became purely mechanics focused).It's a good game. It has genuinely unique mechanics and I enjoyed learning them a great deal! Probably not as good as Slay the Spire or Monster Slayers, though, neither in depth (StS) nor breadth (MS). I don't know, I still had a fun time with it. It's different enough to warrant a look, if it seems up your alley.",

        "text": "Very cool shooting mechanics, solid visual style and music, but not much beside that.The visuals are evident from the screenshots. The music is half electric half acoustic blues with a bit of spanish (almost flamenco) thrown into it. Pretty cool.The shooting is definitely the most noteworthy aspect. Each gun controls different rather than just having different stats.For example, the revolver needs to be \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 (hold RMB) before shooting (LMB). A rifle needs to be armed (press RMB) before shooting. The shotgun is only shot, but holds only two bullets at a time. Finally, a bow needs to pull an arrow (hold RMB for longer) before shooting, but it makes no noise and so doesn't alert enemies with sound.There are few weapons, but every one of them is unique and has its use. This is very good!Unfortunately, the game doesn't do much aside from this. You don't have many tools to approach levels differently (although you can stealth kill some enemies with a knife) and often cheese everything by hiding behind a corner as enemies run to be slaughtered unaware.You just go from level to level with some dialogue in between (which isn't great, it's just style, being a rude guy who kills without a thought). There are upgrades you can buy, but they're few and you have no choice about it. When you get to a certain \"intermission level\", it will have one upgrade you can buy. If you pass it, you'll never see it again. There are only 4-5 upgrades overall. You earn very little money from the normal levels, but you can do extra \"grind\" missions (typically 2-3min at most) where you just kill a bunch of guys and earn money for the upgrade. A couple of these missions is enough for each upgrade.This part of the game really didn't need to exist, but it's not a big problem anyway.I don't know. The shooting is very cool, but the game is short and otherwise unambitious. It works. You can get 3-4 hours out of it if it seems your style.",

        "text": "Not good at all.I'll praise the visual style - it looks very good and different from most other games. Great colors (especially when changing with time of day, although it is a bit too quick) and good use of shaders too. Very unique, so nothing to complain there! (Other than the quests and interactable items not being very visible)The reason I really dislike the game as a whole, though, is that it has no really purpose. Like so many other games out there, they seem to have nothing to say or show. Maybe half of the mechanics in the game are completely superfluous, making no difference to play at all. The other half is incredibly simple, presenting no real problem.It's almost a clicker game, in that you're somehow encouraged to keep buying and upgrading things that will only lead to upgrading more things. And even that respect, it fails, since the optimal path to the achievements would probably be not to buy anything and instead save up to buy the last ship. The last point I really dislike is the fact that the world revolves around the player 100%. Instead of you having to look at the world and its rules and figure out how to survive or \"climb the ladder\", the world is always exactly balanced with you. Which is a really bad thing? It becomes a pure hoarding game where you do menial tasks to get the next upgrade until you buy everything. Ok, so you have a ship, and there are islands. You're supposed to go from island to island and buy resources, buy better ships, and do some quests. You can also capture islands and then have a kind of pointless city management segment that is just a waste of in-game money.During the sailing, you're suppose to keep your crew fed, and your ship repaired (for battles). The biggest problem here is that you don't need to control resources almost at all. (1) they're incredibly cheap, so you can stock up entirely and never have too little space or money; (2) you can go between the two extremes of the map without having to worry about feeding the crew. So this removes any aspect of planning from the game. You don't really need to think about which island to visit first, or buy resources accordingly or any of that. So the whole resource system is pointless. Then, there's the battles. In some trips, you have combat. The combat reduces to: A seconds to do B damage OR kill C crew, D seconds to heal E amount. That's about it. Or you can flee. So, really, it comes down to very simple arithmetic. You decide whether it's faster to kill through damage or crew, and you heal before the opponent has time to kill you. There's no problem to solve, here, the solution is obvious so... why? It would be interesting if the timers depended on the amount of crew members, or you could upgrade different aspects and  have to figure out the opponents'... but there's none of that (or at least none that's relevant). So yeah.Then there's the worse fact that you encounter ships based on *your* ship! If you have a tier 3 ship, your encounters will be against tier 3 ships (with some low variability of +-1 tier). The game could have danger zones with higher risk/reward or requiring a better ship to access, but no. Instead, you can probably play the whole game in your first ship, since the game is designed entirely around you. It's pointless.Finally, there's the actual money making. Aside from a finite number of side quests, all you have is a fetch quest (get to this port). And you can have only one fetch quest too! Once you finish it, more will become available, but always one at a time (presumably a way of extending the length of the game in a very artificial game - since it took me 4 hours of very inefficient play). This will earn you between 1k-2k. The last ship costs 50k. You can also conquer towns (which has no mini-game, you conquer it if you have >= X crew, and then lose some of your crew in the process). Once you control a tower, you can build a shipyard, a farm, a mining camp, etc. which I don't really the point of. They make resources available and increase a town's profit by 10% or 20%.Either way, each time you visit a town, you'll get 0.5k, more or less. So it's not really the best way of making money. You can also allocate resources to different things to make more money, but the difference is very small so I didn't bother. Again, there was no point. The game had no challenge. I've never had my towns conquered back (although I think it's possible?) and buying each kind of building would cost 2-5k. For a reward of 0.5k every 20 minutes. Oh, and you also have to visit the town to collect its profit - which means you'll be better off not buying anything and focus on fetch quests entirely.I'm being very harsh, but really. There's no point to the game. The systems are mostly theoretical, and not actually balanced to work in practice. The side quests are few and not very meaningful at all either. The whole game relies on compulsive play. And that's not good. Looks great, but nothing else to it, in my eyes.",

        "text": "This is a game that has very little reason to exist as a game. It seems to be just a vehicle for the background universe/story they've created. But the game itself contributes practically nothing to it. The game mechanics are completely unrelated to the story, nothing happens in the game, and all you do is go around collecting \"data fragments\" that give you a few lines of text related to this universe. But even then, it's all very vague. It points to (close enough as to be indistiguishable from humans) AI, and higher intelligence that becomes unintelligible. But nothing concrete woven into an actual narrative.I'll write about the game itself, since it's the most important (and negative aspect).If you've played stuff like Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Shadow of Mordor, etc., you know more or less what to expect. You have a world with icons on the map and you go to each icon to complete the mission. Except that this game takes only the formulaic aspect and does away with any potentially meaningful bits. I've found quite ugly, actually. The game's measure of success seems to be \"suck up every resource\" and \"capture every base\". You're just consuming the world without a point to it. There are 5 icons (\"events\"). One is a simple checkpoint. One is an ambush where you fight exactly 4 robots. One is capturing a base, where you fight exactly 4 robots and can then use the base as a checkpoint and get new equipment, etc. One is \"press F to scan a generic piece of metal scrap\" that is supposed to be some important relic from the game's world, but you have to imagine it (these are the story missions). Finally, there are places with X number resources. You get resources from fighting and can also find them in the world, so this last \"event\" is rather superfluous. I actually stopped going to them half way through and had no shortage of resources. I've done the whole DLC without going to a single one of these, and the only problem I had was in getting the last \"tier\" of weapons/equipment - which did not matter much.Finally, there are also dodecahedra spread around the world to give you a bit of lore. You can see these by activating you \"detective vision\" (yet another \"standard mechanic\"). These do not show on the map, and you can only come across them at random.Combat-wise, there isn't much either. There seem to be lots of weapons, but there are really only 4. The rest is either stat upgrade or sidegrade (like changing the sight). Only one of the weapons is midly interesting, but not too much: you get to have 1-4 robots to fight with you (depending on the tier), but you don't control them other than pointing where they should go. They're good cannon fodder - which is almost required on Hard mode.Ok, here's the thing. These mechanics are completely generic. For example, respawning is framed as \"hacking a robot\" on the desired checkpoint. But you can't ever switch bodies with a healthier robot (for example, of the ones you control). And you can't respawn in place of a robot outside the base. So, really, the robot isn't there at all, but is merely an excuse.The capturing of bases, also, was supposed to be a fight for control. But none of that happens. I've had at most 2 bases recaptured by the enemy - and, more importantly, they were recaptured when I was close to them! The world isn't moving. They simply spawn 4 robots at random if you're close to the base, which leads to a recapturing chance. In effect, once I captured a base, it was mine forever. It was just another icon to hunt, nothing meaningful.Then, there is the shooting. This seems to be a very clear case of the developers implementing all the \"standard\" mechanics with no thought put into why they did that in the first place. You can press Q to \"hold your breath\". As a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 robot. Sure, it's not \"holding your breath\", it is steadying the aim. But you're a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 robot. There is no destabilizing motion like breathing that you need to control, so why making an unsteady aim in the first place?! Also, reloading weapons works by \"recharding with energy\". But this is just a coat of paint, since reloading always empties the gun and you have to wait fully for the reload. If it was recharging, surely, you would be able to recharge faster if your weapon had more charge. But no. Every mechanic works exactly in accordance with the industry standard even when they make no sense for this particular game.I'll say it again: this game has no reason to exist. 99% of it is just \"standard\" stuff. There was no game idea here. There was a world (which you may or may not find interesting), and they somehow wanted to force it into a game.There are also some maze parts which bugged out for me, but whatever. Although people call them \"non-euclidean\", they're not. They're just mazes with portals. You often have to start with trial and error until you figure out what each portal connects to.Honestly, just play the DLC if you already bought the game. It's exactly the same (except the end, which lacks one important thing), but shorter. And the combat is much tougher (mostly because they've decided to space out the checkpoint way more. Too much, in fact, in the last section). The world also looks significantly better. In the main game, the \"landmarks\" are extremely generic and say nothing. In the DLC, there is *some* effort put into it.Story-wise, I won't say much. The story telling in the game is bad, in my opinion, since you get pieces at random and read them at the base all at once. One problem I have with the game, also, is that these are not really machines. They're humans. They're humanoid (and actually have to carry guns, jump and run like humans, etc.), they speak exactly like humans (well, in writing), and they have religion, for some reason. There seems to be almost no difference in character between the robots and humans. Again, a mere coat of paint.I haven't read the pdf, but I suspect it will be the best thing out of this \"game\". The story seems to have some interesting ideas. But none of those ideas were actually explored in game form. Instead, they've made the most generic game they could as a way of delivering individual paragraphs of lore every X minutes.Finally, I'll end on a positive note. One thing they did very well was the sky! It looks very nice, and it is used in a cool way. For example, the DLC, which is set on the polar regions, has a much longer day-night cycle. At the end of the main game, I'm not exactly sure why, but the world gets all \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. At this point, the rotation of the planet seems affected, which affects the sky in a cool way that also influences the gameplay nicely!Unfortunately, this alone doesn't make a game.So yeah. I don't think this is good at all and may have been *too* harsh on it. The fact is that the developers are competent in making a game, especially in the audio, visuals and animation. They're good, technically. But all that competence seems to have been incredibly misguided in this game. There are hints of potentially interesting things, but nothing was actually developed and made into a good game. ",

        "text": "This is very similar to a game called Before the Echo (previously Sequence), which is probably one of my favourite games. It's basically Stepmania + RPG elements and combat. You have several lanes with tracks following the song, each with different spells and attacks.The problem with Metronomicon is that it goes waaay too far into the rpg field with little care of how (or rather IF) the two genres synergy. In Sequence, you had 3 lanes: an attack lane, a defence lane, and a spell lane. Each spell had its own pattern and length, so it was good to know the spells carefully and use them appropriately in battle. At the beginning, Sequence was quite overwhelming to me - I could barely complete the rhythm sections, let alone focus on the multitasking aspect of combat, lane swapping, etc. Eventually I got used to it, and everything worked well. The combat system wasn't too deep, but it is a rhythm game after all.In Metronomicon, however, you have 4 lanes, each with 3 different spells. The sequence depends only on the character and song, not the spell. Each sequence has 3 parts, and the number of parts you complete chooses the spell. Then there are elemental spells, to which different enemies are apparently weak or strong against? (I'll explain the \"?\"). Each character has a bunch of spells with secondary effects like \"Stun\", \"Blind\", \"Bleed\", etc. I have little clue as to what they do.The point is that the combat system is way too complicated. There are tons of small mechanics that make only a marginal difference - maybe important in an actual RPG where you need to *think* the battles through. Not in a rhythm game where you *dance* the battles through. The worst part about it, however, is that it doesn't matter, in the end. At least not to me. Initially, I cared about the spells and equipment. Maybe 40% of the way through, I decided it was too much work. I knew I had one healing spell and the others were \"generic\" attacks to me. I focused to just rotating between the attack lanes and occasionally healing. I gave no thought to the secondary or elemental effects at all - and things worked just fine. I switched to Hard mode maybe 70% of the way through even, to make things more challenging. I'll say that I switched back to Normal in the final world - not because of the combat mechanics, but because of the actual tracks. Since pressing the wrong button inflicts damage on your character, I was having trouble with the harder songs.So, honestly, all the complications of the combat system add very little to the game. It seems that they've just added stuff to the game without much of a reason. Only confusion resulted. And the game also has some visibility problems where it's not very clear how much HP the enemies have, their element, secondary effects, etc. Another issue I have with it (and this is almost a positive if you don't think about it too hard) is that you rarely have to play tracks multiple times. There are a few \"sidequests\" that require this, or an optional mode, both for gear, but they're not very prevalent - especially after dismissing the whole equipment management. The problem with this is that you never really have to learn the song or track. They also can't reuse the same songs in higher difficulties, etc. And I think that something is lost there.I think there's value in practicing a song, even in a \"fake\" system like this. A \"fake\" system has the advantage that you can play a simpler version of a track before moving on to the harder version, which you can't really do with a real instrument. It also makes the game much less impactful, to me. I was just going through the motions. Sequence, I think, was a tricky and \"formulaic\" game regarding equipment. You actually had to grind for the materials, and each new piece of gear/spell was so much more powerful that the previous one that you basically *had* to get it to advance. But this made the progression more controlled, and so the levels had a much better sense of difficulty. Especially in the late game, you could really spend hours practicing a song to get a perfect score and finally get that new spell. Metronomicon has none of that. I could have tried a bit harder in the last few levels (instead of reducing the difficulty back to Normal), but take into account that that was the last 10% of the game. Also, I don't really think the combat is very good regardless, so I just wanted to get on with it.Finally, this is a general remark about the stepmania \"genre\". There's a really cool aspect to the ambiguity of the controls - on a controller. The DPad and the XYAB buttons do the same thing, so you always have a choice of which to use in the moment. This leads to a nice \"real-time\" problem solving when you see a pattern and have to decide which sequence of buttons is the easiest. This is something that is present in most stringed instruments (where the same note can be played in different ways), but not in many rhythm games (say, Guitar Hero). I think there's a lot more potential here, using a more complicated control scheme. Almost like improvisation (only without the output). Or, you know, play an actual instrument! But the barrier to entry is lower so yeah. Anyway.Not a fan of this. Sequence will give you the same \"flavour\" of RPG+Stepmania, but in a much better way.I also almost neglected to mention - I really dislike the music in this game! It seems mostly pop or electronica, but most of the tracks and melodies are rather predictable. The focus was too narrow, I guess. It had maybe 4 or 5 synthwave tracks, which I prefer, but still... If you like the music, the game can be alright. If you don't, however, the gameplay itself will probably not be good enough of a reason for you to play this.Maybe you disagree. ",

        "text": "It's okay if you get it for free, but not otherwise.I'm a big fan of Orcs Must Die, and hadn't played it in years, so this seemed a good alternative! Unfortunately, it's worse in every respect but the graphics?It's a solid game in general, but I find it really lacking in the specifics of the genre. It looks great, sounds good and has a nice 50's sci-fi style. All good there.The idea of making a class-based OmD also seemed great, especially for co-op. If each class played wildly differently from one another, it could lead to a lot more replayability. Alas, not the case. There's a very limit amount of traps (and even less when you consider that it's like {floor, wall, turret, soldier} x { fire (damage over time), ice (slow), electricity (chain) }. Pick one from the first set and one from another and you have every trap in the game. There's very variability between classes too. The main point of difference seems to be the weapons which, while important, should not be the focus on a trap defense game!A worse problem is the level design - I don't understand how they've done this so poorly. There are multiple paths, but they always prevent you from placing traps in the cross-sections! So you basically have to treat each path separately instead of finding clever trap combinations in bottlenecks, etc. This removes half the fun of the game! I should also say that there are no \"barricades\" of any sort, so you can't redirect the hordes in any way. Some of the levels seem very difficult because of this. All you need to figure out, in the end, is which type of elemental to use against a particular enemy type and you'll be alright.Finally, the online scaling isn't good at all (read the reviews). Enemies seem disproportionally strong based on the number of players - Solo is still tough, but it's far more manageable from what little I've played of multiplayer. I've completed Normal mode with one character and played until halfway through on Hard with another. Now I'm dropping the game because the two characters don't play meaningfuly different. Finally, one last thing I feel could be done much better: there are no optional objectives on the level. So once you're done with them, that's about it. There doesn't seem to be any kind of relevant scoring or experience scaling with how well you do. In Orcs Must Die you were graded based on your performance, earning you more xp to buy more traps, etc. Way more to explore there.Here, not much. It's unfortunate, since I really enjoy these games.Don't get me wrong, I had an alright time. It's not a bad game, but it's also not very good - the biggest problem is that you have an alternative that's better and deeper in every way. So yeah. If you got it for free, give it a shot. Otherwise, consider buying Orcs Must Die 2 (hell, even the first!) instead.",

        "text": "Not a bad puzzle game at all! It actually had some very clever use of the mechanics - and in the introduction of new mechanics that were related to the previous ones in a surprising way.Not a hallmark of puzzle design, but still enjoyable to play.My biggest complaint is that the game gets a bit too diluted with the constant introduction of new mechanics. The main mechanic, I suppose, is that you have sheep, wolves, and have to get an exact number of each to an exit point. Each island has a limited number of spots, and only adjacent (on the square grid) islands let animals be moved. Also, wolves eat sheep, and well fed wolves will permanently occupy a spot of the island, unable to move.Initially, all the puzzles involve a certain number of sheep surviving, to get to the exit. At some point, they introduce a mechanic where, instead of getting X sheep to the boat, you have to kill X sheep. I was not expecting this, but it is a very natural extension of the mechanics that lead to many more possibilities!Compared to that, some of the mechanics were a bit more artificial - pressure buttons that must be pressed to avoid burning sheep on a different island, some weird teleports, a totem that kills everything on an island, etc.I don't think they were bad mechanics, simply that there were too many mechanics, and the more artificial ones could have probably been avoided to explore the \"fundamental\" ones more thoroughly.Regardless, I had a good time with it!",

        "text": "Owlboy is an okay game. It has a lot of really impressive aspects, but the game itself ends up doing little, in my opinion.The pixelart is really amazing, and obviously the main draw of the game. There is a lot to look at and it looks really good. The only complaint I have it that it doesn't differentiate between foreground and background well at all, in some places... Still, if you're interested in pixel art, definitely take a look at Owlboy. It also has one of the best nightskies! Not a lot of attention is typically played to the sky, but they've done a great job.The music is also surprisingly good! But it's almost \"film music\". It sounds very good, and it complements the scenes very well, but in a very disney movie-like manner. The story also fits into this, I think.One surprising aspect that I really enjoyed was the writing. Not the background story or the main plot, but the side characters. The way they behave, especially. It's impressive how much they've done using sound effects, animations, screen shake and caps lock at the most appropriate moments! The main plot I didn't care much about, really. The background story was also a bit vague, so take it or leave. But the character interactions were really good.The worst aspect is really the game itself. It gets especially bad by the end, if you try to find all the coins.For one, the movement is rather bland for flying. Really, it feels exactly like a walking character, only you can walk up and down. There was one moment where the flying went over the top (in a good way), but that particular section was an infuriating mini-game with a few very important problems that it removes any of the joy in the flying. So yeah, the feeling of flying is not here at all.Then, there's the main mechanic, where you can carry one character that shoots differently. This isn't used very creatively either, they're almost like \"keys\". Sometimes you have to destroy a piece of armor with one character and then switching to kill the moster, stuff like that. The mechanic is a bit awkward, but they've implemented some handy shortcuts that make the experience mostly painless. Still doesn't make it very good, only prevents it from being very bad.The shooting controls were especially bad. Trying to change characters (shoulder buttons) while flying (left analog) and aiming (right analog) and dodging (X) and repeatedly shooting (right trigger) makes it very clumsy. Add to that the imprecise aiming of the analog stick with an weird auto-aim that sometimes focuses on exactly the wrong thing. Heh.At the end, collecting the coins is a mess, since you're only given X/Y coins you have/need for each area. During the normal playthrough, the game often closes doors behind you too, which is infuriating. I wanted to explore two paths, but accidentally chose the main path, being locked out from the alternative one. Once I got back (after finishing the section and moving on with the story, etc. etc.), I didn't really remember where anything was. The game also relies on lots of fake walls for this. Overall, it was just not fun at all. The game also lacks a way of teleporting between areas, making the whole process more painful. Wouldn't recommend going for the extra coins, the reward isn't worth all the hassle.Honestly, the gameplay wasn't very good. But I'd say the writing, artstyle and music make up for it. At least to make it an enjoyable experience. Given how good the art and music are, I was expecting an equally good game, but that seems to have been somewhat neglected. Not a game I was terribly excited playing, but there are certainly noteworthy aspects!",

        "text": "It's a fun little game. Was certainly fruitful to me, gave me a few ideas to try out in the visual department. Nice tilings!I also really like the combo mechanic. Basically, the game consists in collecting at least X coins in each level. Coins are found on the ground, or awarded by killing enemies. The great thing is that there are flying enemies who die in one hit, and each one gives you an extra air jump. For each enemy you kill without touching the ground/walls your combo rises, giving you +1 coin per enemy. The mechanic isn't deeply explored, but the idea is still nice! And there are some sections when you're supposed to get your combo up using this mechanic.Would be nice if the game explored this with different mechanics (a bit like Guacamelee?), but hey.The game's structure feels a bit unexplored. If you collect more than X coins, you get to keep them for the next level. But not if you die (and it is common to die), so it loses a bit of purpose. It's also very easy to get the coin requirement, even without worrying about comboing and exploring everything, so... yeah. The structure is enough for a small, unpretending game, but I think it should have been more fleshed out.The exception to this is the lava levels, which are time limited. I really disliked this aspect of the game.Controls are too unprecise - a single directional press will make the character move way too much. Something else that was almost good but ended up lackluster is the mana system. You can get spells to attack/defend which are okay, but you always have a movement spell that can keep you flying while you have mana. Again, this plays nicely with the combo thing! Unfortunately, you have little mana and only recharge by grabbing stuff on the ground. So it never really got anywhere, for me.The extra coins being pointless, it would be cool to be able to invest them into mana or movement modifiers of some kind.As it stands, the game can be a fun little distraction for 3 hours or so. But there are certainly good ideas here that would be nice to see in a more focused and fleshed out game. Most other reviewers already pointed out several of the more general problem, so I'll end my review here.",

        "text": "Good, but feels like the game is holding itself back. I really like the alchemy and monster hunting idea, having to learn about each monster's weaknesses, strengths, and know how to brew the appropriate potions for each situation.But all that isn't really used nearly as much as it should. The game relies almost exclusively on weak enemies, for which alchemy isn't needed. I played the game on Hard mode, but even then, you could breeze through most of the sections without much of a problem... The difficulty, when present, came mostly from an unfair challenge - getting unavoidably stun locked (unless you have one potion) by multiple enemies, or getting thrown into fights before you have any chance of preparing.So yeah. The system exist, but they aren't really necessary, which is a shame. It becomes a much more \"average\" RPG than it could have been. Too compromising, I suppose... I should play the later games to see if they've gained confidence with their success.Still, the game has unique lore which shapes the story and gameplay nicely. The combat is a bit clunky, very sticky, and there's low feedback which results in you not knowing if an attack is registering or not.Not as monumental as Demon's Souls, but still a good game. ",

        "text": "I really don't like this? I played this because I've seen Michael Brough mentioning it as great game... I disagree?I think the game has some cool ideas, but definitely none of them are enough to made a game around it, as they did? I really, really dislike playing the game. The ending was nice, and brought my opinion up a bit, but everything feels incredibly forced.I think Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is a game to be talked about rather than played? The ideas sound good in theory, there's some social commentary (which seems the only reason the game has got the attention it did), but in practice, it doesn't result in a worthwhile thing.This will be full of spoilers, so be warned.First, let's get the most notorious aspect out of the way: gender dysphoria. For some reason, this seems a more prominent topic among game developers than other communities (at least in my bubble). This game has two mechanics. One of them in about gender dysphoria. Basically, your character needs to change genre every 2 or 3 days. You go to an automated kiosk, buy a cheap thing and change your gender. If you don't, the screen and text gets distorted and stuff. That's it. No change whatsoever, except the visual distortion. It seems very forced, and it seems a common \"complaint\" in the forums. I suppose the kiosk serves to show how \"commonplace\" changing genres is in this world. That's fine. But changing every 2 or 3 days seems to trivialize things a lot? But most importantly, it has absolutely nothing to do with the game. Again, it seems like a \"topical\" thing, but not much more than that.I like Greg Egan a lot (sci-fi writer), and I have no problem with the way he uses sexuality. He presents different societies with different norms or habits, that's totally fine. But his books are about something bigger. Sexuality is only a small part of it. Even Ursula K. Le Guin seems to do something similar (though I've only started reading her stuff). Their works have much more to them. DoaSJ doesn't. The game is so barebones that the focus on gender dysphoria seems to suck way too much attention to it, making it a seemingly big deal, and then it doesn't really matter at all. It's like a big billboard screeming \"gender dysphoria\" at you without serving any actual purpose.Whatever.Now, the game itself. The game is about the slog of daily life, I suppose. Getting stuck in an unproductive and unhappy routine. The game certainly achieves that. You incinerate trash for money. Everything is ludicrously expensive. Then there are guys who steal half your money if you collide with them, because \"\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you\". The problem is that the game is full of items that are nothing, other than their description. At the start, I tried buying some items, like books, hoping that I would be able to read them. Nope. They're really just a description. So... why?The game is just a whole lot of nothing. And it feels wrong.Sure, routines can be pointless. But you CAN look the other way and find other things. Except in this game, you can't. I can't stress enough how much nothing there is in the game. The NPCs have 3 lines of dialogue, maybe. There's barely anything about the world or its people. The city is full of vendors, who sell nothing.Again, it \"sounds\" good. To make a game about such a relatable thing as unhappy routines. But it's incredibly forced. It's something that look nice when people write about it, but the game doesn't really say much.One kinda cool aspect of the game is that the vendors buy and sell different things each day (and each day of the week). It's cool, until you realise:(1) They sell nothing.(2) They sell a sword (nothing) for 400 credits, but they buy it from you for 8. So. I go around, seeing what they sell. \"Oh, cool, an expensive item I've found on the ground\". Then I try to sell it and get nothing for it. There goes the whole mechanic.The game also doesn't last long enough for you to really realize the week mechanic and figure out any patterns. Given the time you have, and the fact that nothing is explained, you may as well treat it as a random thing. I spent more than a week (game time, not real time) to find a relic. First, I found it in some vendors, but didn't have enough money. Then, I checked it every day with no luck. Until a different vendor randomly had it. The time inbetween was just full of nothing, since I had every other item I needed for the quest.The game has a dungeon zone. Also completely empty, except for a single item you'll need for the quest.The game also has a worship-luck mechanic where you can pray to several different gods to get luck. I have no idea about the purpose of this. My luck was around 700-800, for maybe the latter half of the game. The highest achievement for luck is at 500, so I suppose I was doing okay? But it didn't really help me find the item I wanted. If it raised my selling prices, it was by very little, and not at all relevant to the actual game.I also have no clue what the different gods do (if anything), because the game has no mechanics.Really, I just don't know what to make of the game. Apparently, speed-running is a thing. This is kinda cool, because of the random nature of the game. For speedrunning, knowing how different gods affect the drop rates (of the specific quest items) is good. Also knowing the optimal items to find/buy and sell, where they spawn, etc. But none of this is actually relevant to the main game. And the game is certainly not about speedrunning out of the shelf. So...?I spent the first half of the game very confused. But somewhat interested. Then, I started understanding how little there actually was and it became incredibly tedious (though still confusing).Ok, one last criticism - that could be good thing, fitting with the theme. You pick trash up from the ground. This forces you to look down most of the time. As a result, you don't really look at the city, NPCs, etc. This seems like a crucial aspect in creating some disorientation. I'm not sure this was intentional, but I can imagine it fitting with the dreary theme of the game. I lied, I have one more complaint. The interface is also not very good. It would be very easy to make things easier, especially in a game that relies on extremely repetitive actions. When you pick up trash, the mouse resets to the center of the screen, and you have to drag it to a button to incinerate it. I don't see a reason for it not having a button (like Q, something close to WASD) to do it automatically, but hey... Ok, I was extremely negative in this review. I kinda feel that way about the game... I really don't understand how people praise this game so much. Different strokes for different folks.I have one thing I really liked about the game, though: the music and sound design. Well, I didn't really like the music (as in, wouldn't listen to it outside of the game, ever). But it's very well made. There are street musicians basically everywhere, playing on of several instruments (quite a lot, actually), going along with the background music. This was very cool!So, I'll just repeat what I said at the start. The game seems very \"topical\". It has probably gained attention because of this. Makes good press, but it's not well designed to be played at all. The themes feel very forced. Has some nice ideas, but doesn't have nearly enough to make it a good game (and I like strange games that don't fit the traditional notion of game).There are also many vague things about it which, again, creates nice discussions without saying anything at all.I don't know. Not my thing. I really didn't enjoy playing it and the ending, while better, didn't make up for it. Maybe one day I'll \"get it\".",

        "text": "It's an okay game, but very formulaic. Level design-wise, it's a metroidvania with virtually no degree of real mystery or exploration. The secrets are spread around rather uniformly, always where you most expect them, with visual indication to go along with it... I 100% the game on a first playthrough without having to backtrack at all with one or two exceptions. There are no real surprises, which I guess is what I look forward the most in a metroidvania?Other than that, which prevents the game from being great, it's pretty good and I enjoyed my time with it. The theme, again, doesn't really contribute to it being great, but just good. It's a reference to old tv sci-fi, not my cup of tea, but it's okay.The visual effects were actually very nice! Distortion, fire, particles, it has a bunch of different stuff and all were well made.The music fits in with the theme. So, again, it's \"good\" for what it is, but I'm not the biggest fan of what it is.The game was also very easy, which undermined most of the abilities and upgrades. The abilities in the game are very unique, but they never take the foreground. You never really have to stop and think about what to upgrade to overcome a specific section. You just spend your points and move along.So... technically, it's a well made game. But it seems a bit too formulaic, limiting itself by following the genre's conventions (almost present in every metroidvania) without adding something to it. I can recommend if you have nothing else to play, but it's hard to find a reason to recommend this game on its own.",

        "text": "I really liked Might & Delight's previous games, or at least aspects of them, so I was excited to try Tiny Echo.At worst, I expected to find it \"nothing special\". But I think it's actually pretty bad?This is a point n' click game that takes 1.5 hours to finish.The biggest problem I have with it is that I see absolutely no reason for this to be a game. There is not a single thing in the game that uses interaction or choice in any positive way. There are no real puzzles either - the game is so small that every time you \"interact\" (read \"click\"), you solve a puzzle. You just go in a straight line from start to finish clicking everything in sight in each area sequentially and you'll reach the end.The story is completely separated from the player's actions, there is nothing challenging, I don't get it at all. This would have probably worked much better as a small animation?The second biggest problem is that, after deciding to make a game, they made almost the worst game they could. It's an extremely limited point n' click. The hardest puzzle is the game was when my character got stuck in the ground, making it seem like a puzzle when it was just lack of feedback and/or faulty pathfinding.Even the interface is bad. You can hold the right mouse button to drag the camera around, but as soon as you lift it, the camera goes into its initial place like a rubber band. So you can really look at the scenery, or interact with it unless you walk to a place where the camera, at rest, lets you see the thing to click on.Also, the game is infuriatingly slow, and sometimes the character just ignores the fact that you clicked somewhere for it to walk. Everything has 3 second fade-out and another 3 second fade-in, the \"animations\" are just static, fading pictures. Everything takes really long, most of the time not even letting you see the mouse pointer. It feels extremely unresponsive.The art, especially the environments, by Marcus Lindgren, look absolutely amazing. But even then, they're smaller than the screen, making it impossible to take it all in at once.The music and sound design were also very good.And this is the thing - going back to no reason for this being a game. Tiny Echo's strengths have nothing to do with the game, and the fact that it is just a primitive point n' click only detracts from those aspects, in my opinion.I don't know. People seem to enjoy it. I was disappointed, and very unexpectedly.  ",

        "text": "Very pretty game.I like the concept and it hints at a background/civilization. Not sure that the 10minute concept serves the game very well. And neither does the 10 second? I noticed some of the things moving very slowly, but only in details - the fountain, the tree leaves, the waterfall. The important set piece, I think, was the crumbling statue. This I completely missed, probably because it falls rather slowly? Also, since you only have 10 minutes to play, I didn't really stop to smell the flowers, so to speak. At least not long enough to see it crumble as intended? When I got there, I had spent time visiting other places, so most of the pieces had already fallen.The really good think I took from the game was the terrain. So, this is a very standard walking simulator. All you do is walk. The thing is that it didn't feel boring at all, at least at the start. The reason for this is that the terrain is full of hills, not letting you see beyond them. As a result, at the start of the game, it actually feels like exploring, since you choose the hills to climb, hopefully discovering a new landmark once you reach the top. The walking around felt much more like exploration than any games in the genre as a result! It doesn't hold forever, however, since it loses that effect once you know where the places are - and you will know, because the game relies on repetition.The biggest problem I have with the game is actually that you play the game several times. I like the idea of being limited by time. But NOT when you can just restart? The time limit loses all the force it could have had when you simply replay, effectively resetting the time.The story is nice. The whole game represents the final moments of a comet strike. This is a recurring comet, recorded across centuries, named as the \"Nomad\", rather supersticiously. Several factions form around this concept, and one decided to record the civilization for posterity (also an important concept to these people, who believe is a continuous stream of consciousness, more or less, where both offspring and history link everyone together). One problem is that the whole game is very short, and the story is almost entirely communicated through notes. The landmarks are related to the notes, but not in a very impactful way. The buildings are pretty, but they're rather isolated and iconic more than anything else.It's a nice little game, if you know you won't get more than 1 or 2 hours out of it, in all likelihood. It's a product of a ludum dare (so 48 hours), and the whole structure reflects that. The game was more fully developed in this release, and it shows! But the limitations of the core idea are still present. So there you go. Would recommend if you want a short game and find it on a cheap sale.P.S.: almost forgot the music. The music sounds good, and I like the detail at the \"end\" of the game. One problem I have with it is that it is extremely simple. And by simple I mean both composition and instrumentation. Although each landmark has its own short song, they all sound the same. So they don't really reflect the landmark that they should? It's nice music, but it has no real meaning in relation to the game, so it there is a shortcoming there.",

        "text": "Last Day of June is much better than I expected! Very well made, although it does have some problems - mostly minor. If you like purely narrative games, give it a shot.This will be full of spoilers and conjecture, so consider not reading this review if you plan of playing the game.I'll start with some objective negatives. The game relies on solving some puzzles (very tied to the story) that were meaningful, but the design was sometimes misleading and the amount of repetition in the cutscenes with no option to skip them can be a problem. This was especially bad when the game crashed, forcing me to replay a whole chapter with all the slow, non-interactive cutscenes. It also deleted some progress which locked me out of an achievement without me realizing. Not too important, but a minor annoyance.Another minor annoyance is that there is no way to replay specific scenes after beating the game. In fact, I missed one collectible that I expected to have to play the last character to unlock. But this was not the case, because when you finally play the last character, the game is fully linear until the end (this was against the expectation set through the whole rest of the game). When you finish the game, you can only restart the whole thing, resetting progress. This... is very annoying. The game is very slow moving, and while I do like the mechanics in the context of the story, I don't think the design fits multiple replays. It's great for one playthrough, playing with what you, as the player, don't know about. So yeah. These are just gameplay annoyances that don't have much to do with the \"intended\" experience of the game.I really like Steven Wilson's music, and that's definitely the reason for me to want to play this game. The music was well chosen and fits most of the scenes well, with two exceptions. The music during the cutscenes works perfectly. The first problem I had was during the child's scene. The background music was a loop from one of Wilson's songs that I know well. And that particular loop was a calm moment leading up to a of heavier climax in the song. The loop, then, seems to be constantly leading up to something that never resolves. If you're actually listening, (and maybe the problem is aggravated by me knowing the song, although I suspect otherwise) you can feel the build-up. But then the loop restarts, and it feels wrong. I don't think this is just me expecting the particular change in the song, but a fairly \"generic\" build-up that everyone expects in western music.Luckily, this only happens in one scene, but it shows one problem of having \"independently\" composed music in a game.The second problem was actually at the very end. This one was directly tied to me knowing the song. Once again, it was a kind of build-up. But a whole section of the song was skipped, jumping straight to the end. It's not that the cut was badly done or doesn't fit - it's just that I'm familiar with the song, and so have previous expectations. When the game didn't meet them, it felt wrong, \"breaking immersion\", if you will.I think both of these problems are interesting. It's a risk to use music that people are already familiar with, since you don't really know what kind of relation people have with the music you're using and it may result in a very different experience than the one intended by the developer.Ok, music out of the way.The game is absolutely beautiful. It looks unique and is very pretty, especially the lighting and coloring. There are also some cool paintings at the start of the game, and the impressionistic (Van Gogh-like) texturing works very well.I'd like to mention a big missed opportunity, now. It's not important, but it immediately jumped out at me. Spoiler warning.The main character is in an accident and ends up in a wheelchair. There is also a scene showing the difficulties of being in a wheelchair through a cutscene of the character trying to reach a can of food. But then, actually controlling the character is very easy! You control it with the analogue stick and it's even faster than walking. This was the perfect opportunity to show, through gameplay, the awkwardness of being in a wheelchair. Instead, they went in a completely different direction in making it easier... I feel like this is especially relevant, because you don't control the main character, most of the time. So it wouldn't affect the actual gameplay, but only the scenes where you play as the main character, in between the actual game scenes. So yeah. Feels like an important miss for me, but certainly not a game ruiner.Finally, I'll get into the story. I got way more out of it than I expected, and that's good!You're recalling memories that lead up to the accident that killed your wife. Rearranging events, considering alternatives, trying desperately to find a way to prevent it, it seems.But beyond that, I think it is really a matter of guilt. You never replay the scenes with your character or your wife. Instead, you play only scenes of the neighbours. And, more importantly, the first three scenes are clear examples of carelessness. Those characters weren't careful and ended up causing the accident, so it feels like you're almost trying to find a way to blame each of them. This happens right until the last character, the old man, which you can't blame at all, and it is shown as hesitation when confronted with the memory. This is also the scene during which the world starts blocking every path. The old man, who only offered you a present. There was nothing careless about his gestures, only affection, and so you're unable to find a way to blame him. Ok, so maybe I'm reading too much into the story? Maybe it really is just a guy remembering and trying to \"fix\" it. I think both interpretations are valid, though.Either you first remember what went wrong, in reality, and are trying to fix it.Or you remember the guilt that you've created in your mind, and are progressively remembering things how they really happened, realizing that it really was nobody's fault and accepting that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 happens.There is also a twist at the end which I'm not a big fan of. That is, the twist seems to be there because \"stories have twists\", and not because the twist gives meaning to the story? Anyway, I've ranted for long enough. I enjoyed it much more than I expected. It's not quite up there with Journey or Brothers, in the way the story is setup and relates to gameplay. But it's still very good and you should definitely give it a shot, if it sounds up your alley! ",

        "text": "Here's a game that does random events well, for a change. A vast array of classes to play, each introducing variation into the events, revealing specific options (which may lead to side quests?). Great!Unfrortunately, each run take 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hours which makes replayability way more daunting and tedious than it should be in a rogue-like. Well, there goes a possibly great game...The game can be compared with Sunless Sea, although it's focused on combat (in events) instead of the actual sailing and resource management. Also, the lore and aesthetic isn't nearly as good.Still, the game grabbed me unexpectedly. It's very addicting (which is not necessarily a good thing...?). I want to finish it, but the length of each decent run is seriously waaaaay too long and it actually diminishes a lot of the game's cooler aspects because few people will feel like playing the game for such a long time.I assume that the runs get faster once you know what to do... but the game has a lot of hidden information, so you'll probably wander confusedly for hours at the start. I'm still very unsure about many aspects of the game... it may remove a lot of filler once I figure them out.I'll probably update this review. I'm not 100% convinced on the combat - there seem to be a lot of status effects that are mostly the same and so could be streamlined instead of having so many pointless names? - and the game's progression seems very minimal - no leveling up, sometimes you get positive and negative stat modifiers, though. The most significant seem tied to an important sidequest too, so...So I wouldn't think this to be a great game. But it might be a \"good\" one. Not on close inspection, but to play. That surely counts._________________________Update 1: Ok, runs get a bit faster, but not that much. The game is incredibly slow moving and takes at least 1 hour, probably 2 to get started. By get started I mean getting a full team of 4 together a making one alliance. Even the start is very hard, and it always feels like you're underpowered in battles (Normal mode) and barely getting out with everyone alive.It's starting to feel more and more annoying to play for hours and then have one encounter \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you over. The game is too \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 long for the whole rogue-like formula to work. Especially as the sidemissions are almost all repeats, at this point. Maybe it could work in Sunless Sea, where the siedquests were much more fleshed out, numerous, and part of the core of the game.Here, you're playing in a fairly generic fantasy work and most side-quests are \"amusing\", references to pop culture, and other flavour stuff.I'm getting more and more negative as I play, because the various elements are starting to conflict with one another.The combat is starting to seem a bit repetitive as well, as most classes are very similar, coming from a core. Almost every attack is \"Deal 3 or 4 damage + side effect\". Combat doesn't get wildly different as a result, from what I've played. The game is really about figuring out how to get the 1% advantage to beat the game.... heh.",

        "text": "I don't really get the appeal to this game. It seems to be just a coat of \"edge\" and \"style\" with very little game beneath?I really dislike the use of \"perma-death\" and \"random events\". You can look at FTL and see how it's actually good. Especially regarding the random events, each one can unlock more events in the future, reveal cool sidequests, etc. This game has none of that. Events are as bland as they get - and sometimes they just kill you and make you restart. With no warning. It makes no sense.Death serves no purpose other than inflate the game's length either, since every run is essentially the same. There's very little variation. The whole game is \"end-game planning\" with no \"local loop\". You spend the whole time managing sliders to train the stat you want until it's maxed, and then changing to a different one. Equipment is a linear upgrade - get gold and click until you reach the max upgrade. The \"skill tree\" can be fully filled in a single playthrough, so you just try to fill it without much regard to which skills you pick first.The whole thing is just like a clicker with an end. I will say that I really enjoy the \"twist\" at the end, the first time I played. I don't want to spoil it, but it was great. Unfortunately, only works the first time.The music was kinda cool, but didn't go anywhere. Stylish, but there isn't much of it nor does it serve any purpose other than style.I just don't understand the game, I guess. I felt like I was mindlessly clicking the stat I wanted. No strategy to the battles, barely any real resource management, as most of the upgrades are exhausted early on and you just wait for the remainder of the time.Not a game for me.",

        "text": "Nova-111 isn't a bad game, but I feel like it is way too diluted in both mechanics and level design. It constantly introduces new mechanics before getting to the real meat of its previous mechanics. They show a cool trick or two, and then introduce something else that makes the previous mechanic redundant. I also don't think the the real-time element served the game, really? It was something cool for the game's pitch, but the implementation didn't really go anywhere.So, the part that I really like: the enemies. Each enemy is pretty unique and has a few different ways you can tackle them. This is my favourite part of the game. First, learning about their patterns and figuring out how to deal with them without tacking damage, with the fewest amount of moves, \"energy\", etc. Second, to see them being used in puzzles and sometimes in surprising ways. So far, so good. This core of the game is very good.The problem is the overarching level design (so like, not the specific bits of levels design and minipuzzles, but the way they fit together with the primary and secondary objectives). The main objective of the game is simply to reach the exit.Then, there are scientists hidden around the levels for you to find and collect, if you want. There are also health upgrades similarly hidden. Finally, there are the leaderboard for time and turns taken, separately. The first problem is that each \"level\" is actually 3 levels. Actually separate levels. You need to complete all 3 in one go. If you die, you respawn in the current of the 3 sub-levels, but not if you quit the game. I don't understand this decision? I mean, they're actually separate levels. You can't travel from one to the other. You can't influence sub-level X from sub-level Y in any way. So... why?The second problem, and aggravated by the first, is that you only see the results (% of scientists/secrets) at the end of all 3 sub-levels. You won't know if you missed anything before. Then, there's the conflict between exploring and speedrunning. The game, from the start, ranks your performance in terms of time. Which goes against the whole exploration thing.Then, there's the fact the levels are rather confusing, even unelegant? In many puzzle games, you have a small level that you can focus on, retry to get a better solution, look at the whole level to figure things out, etc. In here, each sub-level is a bunch of confusing paths between mini-puzzles that aren't really that satisfying. And optimizing for time/turns isn't really an option before you can even know what you're dealing with. The game has a very distracting fog-of-war kind of thing. I don't think it adds anything but noise to the experience, as it was never really used as a puzzle element (actually, there are 2 fogs of war: one permanent, which can be useful to identify untravelled paths; one temporary that act as a kind of line-of-sight - the confusing one).The biggest problem, for me, is that even if the individual puzzle pieces were interesting, the way they're connected was one. Even if it would have been great to figure out the optimal path for each of these small segment, the game's structure was directly against this idea by having big levels that you HAD to explore (really, often multiple paths that you don't really know where they lead or why). These puzzle segments were also not very interesting just to complete, either. I was just going through the motions, because it was impossible to focus anywhere.Some of the secrets are the most interesting parts of the game, because they use a \"twist\" on the mechanics, a suprising use of your tools, to get to. The problem is that the game also used a lot of non-obvious \"one-way paths\". While you're happily exploring, you choose the wrong path once and you can't go back to explore the other one - oops, now you have to restart the whole thing. This is made worse by the fact that sometimes the correct path isn't in a straight line. So you may see a scientist, but don't know how to reach. Then, you try going around, only to find yourself unable to go back. There are many things like this in the game.I'm mostly rambling. But the game was very confusing, to me, which is reflected in the writing. It's not an elegant puzzle game. It's a game made up of possibly elegant pieces haphazardly arranged as to destroy that elegance. I enjoyed the first world. After that, the game lost my attention. I still played to completion, but I wasn't enjoying it, and the game didn't become any better - on the contrary. All these gripes became more and more common as the game went one.Oh, I forgot to add: many of the secrets rely on fake walls. So, despite encouraging speed and efficiency, the game also wants you to bang against every walls for a potential secret.Conclusion: levels are too big, making it almost impossible to play efficiently the first time through, preventing efficiency. It often prevents you from backtracking, preventing exploration. Just playing the game to reach the end of the level is also not very interesting. Great potential, I just feel that almost design decision conflicts with another and ends up dragging the game down a lot.",

        "text": "For most people, Splasher will be a fun platformer, although one that doesn't add much to the table. I enjoyed it for the ~6 hours it took me to beat the game, with all the secondary objetives. It was enjoyable, it's a well refined game.I imagine that where it really shines (if it does) is speedrunning - the game has several speedrunning modes implemented: time attack (individual levels),no-collectible speedrunning and 100% speedrunning. Even during the main game, you'll see how many of the sections are built to go fast, rather than playing slowly and methodically.This is a cool thing! Although it might have lowered the base difficulty somewhat.The one rather big problem I have with the game is the controls. The main controls are fine, although the character seems to have a bit too much inertia - I found it difficult to stop exactly where I want, etc. I don't see it as a fault, necessarily- I assume it's just a matter of playing enough to get used to the subtleties.The problem is the gun controls - they're pretty bad. The game relies on a mixture of 8 directional input and auto-aiming. The 8 directional input seems too primitive when most controllers have analog sticks. why force the 8 directions? Especially when, with auto-aiming, the aim becomes 360 degrees instead of 8-directional! It feels a bit inconsistent, and I often died because I expected to be aiming at something that, in the end, I was not.It's also a bit awkward to aim while you're trying to go fast with the jumping gel - wall jumping, for example, forces you to shoot while pointing left and immediately point right for momentum. Similarly when running forward, you have to aim down for a big jump, while aiming a bit horizontally to keep running. The controls weren't ideal, to me. This matter has been brought up in the forums, but nothing was changed for \"fairness to speedrunners\", who already played with the awkward controls.It's not a huge problem. But it did frustrate me a bit by the end, where the levels were tougher and checkpoints were farther apart.I'm not in a speedrunning mood, so the game ended up being merely \"okay\", to me. If you're into speedrunning, however, it's important to know that the developers seems to have directed more of the design into it than into the more standard experience.",

        "text": "The gameplay is fairly fun for a few hours. Then it gets very monotonous (for me, before the game had time to present all of the story notes; much, much before I maxed out the upgrades).I have two main problems with it: the seemingly inexistent level design, and the wide but shallow upgrade system.The levels are procedurally generated. This doesn't imply inexistent level design - The Binding of Isaac is a great example.The problem here is that every level plays the same way - and it's not an interesting way. You just clear every enemy and in the way open every XP container. That's it. You \"clear\" levels. There isn't really much strategy to them, anything to exploit. It's okay at first, but it quickly get boring after you realize that you've been clearing the same levels (only with replaced and reskinned rooms) for a long time.I think the enemies are randomly placed too? At least I couldn't discern any enemy grouping that required a different approach - the \"dynamic\" difficulty may not be very helpful, since the game starts very easy and takes hours to get challenging. Basically getting you used to careless play that is hard to unlearn when the game gets tough.The upgrade system seems interesting at first, but quickly becomes a grind. In levels, you get shards. 3 shards make a tier 1 crystal. 3 tier 1 crystals make a tier 2 crystal. And so on. I think there are maybe 5 tiers in total?There are 3 branches of upgrades. To unlock the higher upgrades in each branch, you need to have X shards on it.This means that, early on, it matters where you place your few shards.Unfortunately, once you get past the early unlocking, your task to to upgrade all of your maybe 30 crystals. The difference in each tier is probably from 1% to 5%, depending on the tier. So not a very significant difference. Certainly not significant to require careful upgrading of crystals. So the upgrade system degenerated into \"grind levels to get shards and upgrade every single crystal\". No thought, no choice. It's simply not very interesting. So, after finishing the campaign and one fairly good survival run (same as campaign, but you don't respawn), I tried the campaign in Hard mode. I got maybe 75% through. Then I was too bored to continue.It really seemed that I was just going through the motions, playing similar levels over and over and over.The dailies are more interesting, but not interesting enough to keep me coming back.There is also a bit of a problem with leaderboards, since they have a \"Rebirth\" system that gives very substantial upgrades for \"resetting\" upgrade progress. So players with many hours will give away their shards to get like 150% damage done, and just grind again to get the best crystals back. This gives them a huge leaderboard advantage. Newer players will have to play much better to get close to their scores, which doesn't feel very fair?Heh.I really like how the game looks, as they get classical looking arches and columns (gothic, saracenic, etc.) and give them a more modern twist. Unfortunately, it's just a reskin (and doesn't even make much sense within the story?), and the very simple random generation makes the architecture inexistent, leaving only simply motifs. The game also has big problems in visibility. It's hard to differentiate background from foreground. Many XP and Ammo containers are also behind background assets, for some reason. The gameplay itself was fun, for a while. The game tried something new and that mostly worked - but then it has serious problems with structure.It looks and sounds pretty good. The story seemed fairly interesting - similar to Devil May Cry 4 in its futuristic religious overtones.It's not a strong recommendation, but it's not a bad game. ",

        "text": "Update 1: Just later in the day, I've beaten the game with two other classes. One was Ranger, with which I was familiar with. The other was Knight, first time playing it... so I suppose there is also a significant element of learning the game, it's not just \"learn the class\". Took me 20 hours, but it seems like I can consistently win on Normal mode, now. Might be worth giving Legendary a try.Update 2: Add Barbarian to the list. So yeah, once you play enough, you'll be able to win consistently, even with unfamiliar classes. I guess the trick is learning to have a small enough deck with good draw so you can stack a lot of small effects without losing actions points. Since \"Normal\" mode can be beaten very consistently, I'll give Legendary a shot and see how it changes.Update 3: I've beaten the game with every basic class. Now I'm going through the 6 \"Advanced\" classes, beaten it with 2. So far, I find these advanced classes significantly harder to play, which is good! Their decks are much less versatile, and it's a bit difficult to see what cards will synergize and which will not. The combat is also more strategic, since most synergies have both positive and negatives. The order in which you play things is more important (based, especially, on my Necromancer deck which involves a lot of self discard, but at the same time could build up mana and unleash very powerful spells as a result). All in all, I think this game may lack in the metagame, but it has more than enough variety to keep you occupied for a while. Each class feels very different, every run still feels very fresh. This is an incredibly good game!The artstyle made me pass on it for a long, long time. I rediscovered it on my list recently and decided to try it because of the Slay the Spire craze that's been going on (never played it, once seen it being played).I haven't been grabbed by a game like this in several months, at least. And I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface!If you're reading this to know how it holds up against Slay the Spire (even if I never played it), I can say that Slay the Spire has much more intense combat. Combat in Monster Slayers (at least in normal mode, haven't played legendary) isn't very interesting. Not many choices, unlike Slay the Spire in which you have to consider every turn, react to what the enemy is going to do, allocate energy carefully, etc.I think this has to do with the fact that enemies are AIs with a deck just like yours. Same card pool. Their deck is pretty varied, which makes head-to-head combat much more complex, less predictable, and so less strategic, in a sense. The turns almost always play themselves, more or less.This isn't a complete negative! I think the games have a different focus, which is strange given how similar the games are. All I can say is that, although following a similar formula, the games have different hierarchies and are genuinely different. So you can probably enjoy both.This seems like a negative at the start. Because, if the battles seem to \"play themselves\" and you still die, you may feel like there was nothing you could have done. And the game may feel cheesy, in a way. Especially if you're new to these kinds of games, which I am. But the more I play, the more I realize how much more important the deck building is. And this brings me to the major point of difference between the two games.Slay the Spire is more \"locally\" strategic, in combat. In the deck building, I feel that as well. Given that there are only two classes, the decks built seems more varied, and the strategies are more around the deck than the character.In Monster Slayers, so far, I feel like the real overarching objective is to learn the class. And there are many!I've only finished the game with two characters: Rogue and Wizard. In both times I felt like I had complete mastery over the class with that deck. Rogue had basically infinite card draw, killing enemies with a thousand cuts. Wizard quickly accumulated mana until it obliterated the enemy with incredibly powerful attacks.The runs seemed like a build-up to these decks. I was mostly \"trying to reach\" a certain ideal deck and learning a bit more about it each time. Then, at last, I managed to get the great deck for that class and beat the game.Given that there are 12 classes, the game can be quite deep! I believe Slay the Spire has more replayability within the more limited seed (classes, deck archetypes). Monster Slayers is more about learning how each class plays, and finding the \"correct\" deck for it.I'm not an expert at either game, but this is how I feel, so far. I'm going to keep playing since I'm still enjoying it a lot even after close to 20 hours (not usual for me, after I've \"finished\" most games). If you're looking for something like Slay the Spire, but different enough, I'd say give it a shot!",

        "text": "The game looks ok. (one of the special effect looks pretty cool, but it's very bland overall)Music is ok.The combat can be kinda fun. Although I didn't really get to use most of the stuff (parrying, countering, etc.) because you're mostly fight a bunch of enemies at a time, and parrying bosses is not a good idea.The combat is not bad, at least! It works pretty well, aside from minor camera issues, it's fluid, has a few different moves. Pretty good.The problem is how inexistent the level design is. You get 5 stages, each with 4-6 waves, and then a Boss.Each wave consists of a group of enemies (not great variety, but some). Let's say 6-10 enemies. But each wave's enemies come in batches. So you don't have to kill the 6-10 enemies. You have to kill each one 3 or 4 times.You kill one enemy, it comes back to life. You kill the same enemy, back to life. etc.So, instead of having incredibly tank-y enemies, the \"design\" is to simple multiply them. It amounts to exactly the same thing. And it's really boring. Waves take way too long without variation. It's really monotonous.I've beaten the game on Normal, first, and then did a whole Easy run afterwards, to get more of the upgrades and try the combat after understanding it better from the Normal run. The easy run was a bit too easy, but it was fun, and good for experimentation.The main problem with the normal run is that you restart exactly at the wave you died at. This \"wave\" can be a boss. This is similar to my problem with the game \"Let Them Come\". If you succeed, you can get points/money to buy upgrades. If you find a difficulty wall, however, you can't, and so you can't upgrade anything to overcome the wall. I don't mean \"buy your way through to victory\", but maybe buy/upgrade a specific skill for this boss that you never upgraded because it wasn't useful before.This is very annoying. It would have been great to give you the option to go back to previous levels or even difficulties. You could get new upgrades, get used to new combos, etc. As it is, it's not a good system at all and it's my second major problem with the game.The major problem came in Hard Mode. The problem with the enemy copies is present. But *also* present is that enemies are incredibly tank-y and deal a lot of damage. I've played 4 waves of Hard mode and I decided to drop it. Not that it's very hard (although I'm sure it can get so), but that enemies take so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 long to kill. It's really, really, boring. It's not fun difficulty.So there you go. Maybe if you're really into mastering a game you can enjoy this. I just found it incredibly boring by the end. And the fact that you can't replay levels to try new combos/get new upgrades made the whole experience much less enjoyable.P.S.: I forgot, but most bosses were also not very good? They are mostly immune to stuns and completely break your attacks, so you can to beat them with \"death from a thousand cuts\". Let the boss attack, dogdge it, hit it twice for 1% of its HP and then back off so you don't die.Not fun at all, to me.Again, I think the combat is pretty good! But nothing in the game really shines the spotlight on its qualities.",

        "text": "Update 2: Wow. They've somehow found a way to inject zombies AND artificial intelligence into the game.The writing doesn't get any better at all. For the whole game, the game's sole dialogue is bad flirting. It makes absolutely no sense. The ending is also pretty bad and seems like a \"twist\" for the sake of it, which also relieves the writer of thinking about any backstory or world-building whatsoever.The gameplay is... well, the \"main\" playstyle is rambo style. There isn't much tricking enemies or anything. Most of the \"gadgets\" are also useless. So you rely on your guns, kill a bunch of enemies and hide in a corner. That was my experience, anyway.The game forces you to fight and run through cameras all the time (I [bold]mean[/bold] force - no multiple paths).There are also some bugs on the last level.The game does well to include two bonus \"challenges\" in each level such as not being detected, not using certain weapons, etc. The game severly lacks any actual objectives within the levels, though. It's colored card hunting. That's it. You run from A to B to C until the exit.As I said, the game looks pretty good. That's about it, though.There's barely anything worth playing, here. It's a working stealth game, I suppose, but there's nothing here that you haven't seen in 99% of other stealth games, so why bother?----Update: Ok, I'll update stuff at the top since I doubt anyone will read what's at the bottom.The game's cone of sight doesn't work as it should - and it's a real problem.Aside from it looking like shadows popping in and out all over the place (ruining what's otherwise a very nice looking game, I'll say), it's also .. wrong.See, what they want to do is to gray out the areas the player can't see, and make enemies disappear. The problem is when there are \"gaps\". You can be looking exactly at an enemy, but the model will not be drawn if the gap is on the right place. This means you *should* see a bit of the model, through the gap, but you don't. (Technical detail: it can be fixed by using a stencil to draw the shadow areas and drawing the models where there aren't shadows? You seem to know graphics much more than I do, so I assume it's an oversight)This is especially annoying since in this level I can't use the \"scanner\", which tells me enemy positions. It seems the ideal place to use small gaps as a game mechanic... but it's not working correctly so yeah.___Played very little so far, but it starts badly. (1) The dialogue is really terrible. You're a big badass secret operator who was beaten and lost memory. Then you have a female partner with a big opening to show cleavage with whom you immediately start flirting with despite being in a life and death operation. It doesn't help that the flirting is very bad either.(2) The game shows only keyboard prompts. But it doesn't accept keyboard controls if you have a controller plugged in at all...(3) The field of vision looks a lot like shadows. And it is drawn incorrectly. Sometimes it's a bug when you get close to the wall. Other times it's simply because the field of vision decreases the closer you are to the bars? (This is probably some projection issue, using light-like projection to do vision...)The game looks pretty good, visually. But the writing is really, really, bad. I mean, it's only hurting the game, there's no positive there. Nor is it really relevant, so far. So it's just bad and has no reason to exist. I'll play a bit more. If the missions don't get better, I'll probably drop it altogether.",

        "text": "Played the first episode, lasted around 1 hour.It's alright. I really like the look and sound of the game, it's very much its own thing!Don't expect much, gameplay-wise. For some reason, I've found \"legendary\" equipment early on (hidden in a bush) that made combat very easy. Not sure if I was supposed to do that or not. Since the game is around an hour long, and mostly dialogue, one shouldn't expect much depth, mechanically. No progression or anything, aside from leveling up (you get stats and skills). Only the boss seems to require any strategy (unless you get the legendary weapons, in which case he's very easy?).Still. It's short and unique, so it won't hurting giving it a go.--------------Update: finished the second episode, now. Also just over 1 hour.Get a bit more backstory about the characters, a better feel for the world.Not too invested in the setting, however. Maybe a bit *too* fantastical?The gameplay starts to show very formulaic. The two structures had essentially the exact same structure (story and gameplay-wise). This time, although I quickly found the legendary weapons, I tried not to use them. Was still very easy. So yeah. If you're looking for a combat oriented JRPG, look elsewhere.It's a nice little game, though. Also available for free on the developer's website if you're curious.-----------------------Update2: finished the third and last episode. You get the rest of the backstory, tone is similar to the other episodes, it's alright.Gameplay-wise, less formulaic, which is good. It also got very arbitrary, which is bad. Basically, combat was mostly useless in this episode. And yet, the \"good\" ending is tied to your level. If you don't fight enough, you don't get the good ending... this makes zero sense, given the episode's context. No enemy dies, so you can just fight the same enemy repeatedly to get above the \"threshold\" level and get the good ending.Note that this has no relation to how you do in the final battle - I could understand if you needed level X to be the battle. But no. I beat it the first time with no problems at all (didn't even use the legendary weapons again, to make things interesting), but got the \"neutral ending\".Then I reloaded, killed the same enemy 20 times, and suddenly got the \"good ending\".The environment interaction is also a bit annoying this time around. Basically, it plays like a detective game. Unfortunately, \"you\", the player, have no role in how it goes, really. Finding the item you need depends on which part of the story you're in. I've looked into the correct places before it was time and the game gave me no information from it. Once the story clued me into looking at those exact places, however, there was progress.Essentially, it's 100% linear and what you do has 0 influence on how the game progresses. So yeah. Game-wise, this was the weakest episode. The game itself isn't great.But I still like the artstyle and music a lot for its uniqueness. The story has its own character as well, even if it wasn't \"my\" character at all.It's short and not challenging (which can be a good thing, at times). Not very remarkable, but I like the details added into it. Makes up for its shortcomings, for me. Don't regret giving it a shot, got some enjoyment out of it.",

        "text": "So I came across this guy on Twitter because of some visual effects he made. He had a bunch of really cool looking effects and it was very cool to see! Then I learned he had made a game a bought it to see if I could learn something from the visual effects. The game looks really good, but it's mostly pixel art, not very unique effects or anything. Well, fair enough, that is no reason to give the game a negative review at all. All things considered, it still looks great! So that's fine. The problem, really, is that I don't think the game is very good.Basically, you have a turret and enemies comes. You have to kill them before they reach you.The problem is that the game's foundation is consumable items. Either grenades, or special bullet types. By killing enemies, you earn gold which you can use to buy consumables once you die. The first major issue is that, without those consumables, you have nothing else going on. So, eventually, enemies will overrun you. Then you die and you buy consumables. Eventually, those consumables will probably run out, and you'll die again. Then you'll buy more consumables. You see the point, right? For me, the whole loop revolved around accumulating money to get through X number of waves, at which point I ran out and then bought consumables for X more waves. There are upgrades. But they're (1) rather bland, and (2) you unlock them all in the first level. There are only 5 levels. On the second level, you will only have the chance of getting the second tier of the first level's upgrades. Upgrades cap at the third tier, too. The thing here is that you've seen all there is to see (loadout-wise) in the first level. The remaining 4 levels are mostly about repeating what you did in the first level - except that you learn about the new enemies.Then, there's the fact that upgrades apparently get worse as go up in tier. There are 3 weapons \"upgrades\", which are actually modifiers. Basically, you have \"more heating (bad), more spread (bad) but higher rate of fire (good)\", or \"shotgun (good?) but slow (bad)\" and \"charge for powerful attack (good) but very slow (bad)\". I only found the first upgrade useful. Maybe the others have specific uses, but with the amount of enemies coming, a slow rate of fire seemed like a very quick death sentence.Ok, so now I fire quickly, but the gun heats up. Good thing there's a \"less heating\" upgrade. Great. It works for the first 2 tiers, where the heating upgrade keeps up with the rate of fire upgrade. On the third tier, however, it does not. Which is rather annoying. I did need the upgrade to keep up with the bigger waves. So instead of getting more powerful, I got less powerful. Oh well.Finally, there's the very annoying fact that, when you die, you restart exactly on the wave you died. I don't think this makes any sense. Apparently, there is a case to be made about \"not punishing enough\" games. The thing is that it is too easy to die, but consumables and then smoke the wave in which you died without any tactic, really. When you die in a boss is rather annoying too, because, with less enemies (if any), you'll learn much less money. So you're more or less stuck with the stuff you died with - which, being consumables, can only decrease! (mostly)The bosses are alright, but they're really about using trial and error to find the right ammo type and grenade to kill it.There are other upgrades, like a melee weapons (almost entirely useless since you stop shooting and then get overrun), and there are also powerups you get during the waves, once you fill the combo meter.The game itself, when fighting the waves, can be fun! It's very nice to explode a bunch of enemies at once, and they all splash blood all over, etc. That part is totally fine. But it shows almost everything it has in the first level, and then it's mostly more of the same.I was expecting maybe different weapons (instead of 2 extremely situational modifiers) and upgrades that you could actually plan for. A health upgrade, for example, is almost useless, since you get hit mostly when you're overrun, so that problem isn't too little HP, but too little attack. The meele stop you from shooting, as I said, which also contributes to your being overrun. This renders most of the upgrades incompatible with the type of game they're in.So yeah. Basically, you accumulate wealth to buy consumables that you can slaughter the enemies with until you run out. Then you'll die and buy more consumables.That's not what I expected or was looking for. It can work as an arcade game, I suppose, if you like the arcade micromanaging. Otherwise, the game doesn't really bring much to the table.Maybe his next game will be much better! Here's hoping.",

        "text": "Pretty good shmup. Not very hard and very forgiving, as dying will only reset your score but let you continue pretty much where you left off.For once, I found it nice that it had achievements for the several difficulties - going for the low damage achievement in the easy mode was still fairly challenging and lets you play things differently. Also, as the game is pretty short, it gives you some welcome practice if you're having trouble in higher difficulties.The story seemed mostly anime \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The delivery was also strange, since it relied to a lot of voice-acted exposition (in japanese) during combat! Especially at the start, I was being overwhelmed by the non-standard shooting of the game and all the chaos on the screen to understand what the heck was going on with the story.Not my thing. The music I found pretty generic, which is unfortunate. (I've been playing Einhander which has a really awesome soundtrack). One of the reasons I'm not really playing more of this, for now. I've finished the game on all difficulties, and I'm not much of a score attacker, so...The visuals are a mixed bag. As in, has some pretty \"heh, okay\" stuff, and then has some really awesome stuff. The visuals effects are really great at spots and actually made me try to recreate some of them myself. Not many games make me do that! (let me say the lens flare is reaaaally bad, though).The distortions and flow effects are particularly cool!The environments (aside from the beautiful ending zone) were a bit uninspired, for me. So yeah, I really enjoyed the effects (models are also cool!), but the visuals weren't very striking otherwise.The gameplay seems very unique. You have basic forward shooting, and then have to lock-on enemies and missiles to fire your homing energy things. You also have melee attacks (very important) and a chargeable special attack.Enemies have 4 bullet types: weak bullets you can destroy with your forward shooting; yellow bullets you can destroy with melee; missiles you can destroy with your homing energy; red bullets you have to dodge.This is a bit too much at the start, but it gets very fun once you get the hang of it!It gets even better when you start to pay attention to the score. The game doesn't seem prone to min-maxing, destroying every enemy, timing every moment, etc. A looot goes on throughout. But you build a multiplier (resets when hit) that is maxed at 16 pretty quickly. When you melee kill an enemy, the multiplier drops, but the death gives you more points. So it's then a balancing act of building up your meter and trying to kill as many enemies with a single melee attack to maximize the score.Again, overwhelming at the start. But, trying to go for the harder Easy mode achievements and replaying the campaign you'll get the hang of it!This seems to be how the game is meant to be played. It's more of an arcade experience. Which explain the very short campaign (can take ~30minutes once you've beaten it a few times). The first time it may have taken me 1-1.5 hours because of deaths and difficult controls. I expected to have only finished the \"opening act\" when I saw the credits...I did get my enjoyment out of it, in many ways! Unfortunate that there are so few people who have replayd the game - there are 2 mechs you can played with; On hard mode, one mech has 130 leaderboard results, the other only 30! And you don't need to finish the game to get there... I feel like people are just finishing the short campaign and putting it aside. That barely lets you \"get\" the combat system, in my opinion! So yeah, anyway, rant's over.I think it's pretty good.",

        "text": "Klang is almost good. There is a good game under it, somewhere, but the amount of very significant problems will keep most people away, myself included. The amount of visual noise is mind boggling. 85% of the time, I didn't know how I died or what hit me. For example, you know you have to press a button by a cone in that direction. You know what's also a cone? An attack. They also have more or less the same colors, so good luck parsing what's on the screen. The game also has an excessive amount of explosion effects that obsfuscates the most important kind of information...In a reflex based game, the least you need is to make every gameplay element distinct. This is one of the worst games I've played in that regard.Then, there's the controls. Using the analog stick for discrete input (8 directions) is not a good way of doing things. But that's what this game does. The keyboard controls aren't much better, since you have to press two keys at once to get the 8 directions. Playing with a keyboard, with a ton of buttons, you have to press two keys at once... Again, this is a game where reflexes matter, and pressing two keys at once is awkward and sometimes registers incorrectly because you accidentally press one key before the other.Then, there's the fact that levels are extremely short and not at all song oriented. In fact, the more \"song oriented\" levels are about 1 minute long at most.  This leads to two problems.The first problem is that this simply doesn't work as a traditional rhythm game (in any way) where can just pick different tracks to play through and enjoy your time. 1 minute long isn't enough to get in the flow or have any real progression. You get 3 or 4 short sequences and you're done...The other problem is also related to the unorthodox control scheme and the amount of clutter:Maybe you can learn how to parse all the information and press the right keys intuitively. But that requires some amount of practice. Of which this game has none. Because everything comes in such short sequences, you never get the change to really learn anything. It has a huge amount of checkpoints, so you rarely play for more than 30 seconds at a time. And the game doesn't reuse many elements. One level is rhythmic combat, the other is stealth, the next is platforming, etc. Too fragmented and never gives the player a chance to learn the game.It's rare that I want game to have filler, but this one definitely needs it. Again, most of my time with it was spent in frustrating, not knowing what the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 was going on from all the visual noise and getting tripped up over what keys to press. Finally, there's the fact that there's barely anything \"innovative\" in here. It doesn't push the genre beyond anything. The platforming and the rhythm part are completely independent of one another. Basically, you have to press the right arrow keys on time while also running left and right to dodge beams. That's it. It's just multitasking. The game doesn't use the platforming in a rhythmic sense at all, except wall jumps... Before the Echo was a really good example of a rhythm game that actually tried to do things differently. The game was difficult to play, at first, and involved a good deal of multitasking. But it also had a much better structure, allowing you to get used to the gameplay before presenting the real challenges.140 is a rhythm platformer that is really good as well!This game isn't, really.And it's unfortunate, because the game has a very unique artstyle. It looks very unique and the developer is clearly talented to make all this!And when the game worked, it was good! Unfortunately, it barely every worked for 20 seconds straight. I tried to give it a good chance. I finished the main ending, then completed all of the bonus stages for the extra ending. I also tried \"hard\" mode, which is really just a sped-up version of the main mode (which, come on, now the levels are 45 seconds long instead of 1 minute! And the music doesn't sound nearly as good what are you doing?).I see some reviewers having 10+ hours, one even 90. This game is extremely short, could be easily finished in 1 or 2 hours if you can parse things. So I assume they got over the clutter in time and actually started enjoying their time.I tried, and got a bit better by the end. But then, with all the levels being so short and extremely narrow, I didn't think it was worth to keep playing. It's not like you're mastering a song. Instead, you're mastering very short sequences that while rhythmic, don't have much to do with the song.So yeah. Not to my liking at all. But I think there is a fun game here. Here's hoping KlangM (his next game) will improve where this one fails so that I can try the good game this is supposed to be.",

        "text": "Pretty good game! Nothing groundbreaking, but it's different enough to be enjoyable. It's also very pretty, so it's nice to spend a few hours looking around the world.The game's mechanics were the worst part, especially in the late game. The \"magics\" don't really work very well... From sending enemies off screen (interrupting your typing halfway through), to having a completely random chain lightning (which means (1) you don't know if a given enemy will be chained to and killed and (2) you don't know which enemy will be chained and thus have its current word deleted), you'll be confused a lot of time.There's also a problem with the colors. Contrast is fine at the beginning of the game. As you play along, the game gets brighter and brighter (the world, not the story tone), and so the enemies and their letters start blending in. It's easy to let an enemy slip by completely unseen and have to restart the challenge because of that.Another thing that bugs me a lot is the progression system. It stops halfway through the game? The maximum useful experience is 200 000. I finished the game with 370 000. That's almost half of the experience being useless.It seems that they're aiming for the lowest common denominator, the people who will rush through the game instead of those who will explore and try to complete everything.Why would you do that?It would have been much better to add some upgrades or just modifiers. At least there would be a purpose to explore. It feels weird to reach the 60% of the storyline and have experience become useless. There's not much reason to explore the world at that point...Ok, with the problems very succinctly summarized, I can recommend the game. I had fun and it didn't overstay its welcome.There's also the option for custom dictionaries, which sounds very good. If you're either learning a language (and need familiarity) or teaching smaller children, it's a very welcome option. ",

        "text": "Yet another rogue-lite that doesn't seem to take advantage of what's good about the rogue-lite structure.There are 7 or 8 areas, + a final showdown area. On my first run, I've reached the 7th. Then I had a couple of bad runs, died early. Then, on my second good run, I beat the game. Being \"easy\" isn't really a problem. The problem is that this run took 2 hours. That's too long. Rogue-lites are great to force the player to experiment with weapons, items, whatever. But for this to happen, you should make the game shorter, even if the difficulty scales up faster. I'm much less likely to want to play a game repeatedly if I know it will take 2 hours to reach the end. It also doesn't lend itself to one-sit runs. The game has a ton of weapons, even though some of them are very similar. Sometimes enemies drop weapons, but you also encounter shops throughout the game where you have a selection of 2 weapons (2 primary weapons and 2 secondary weapons in each shop).The alternative use of your money is to buy permanent upgrades, a second life, or heal yourself. This system doesn't go well with the run length.The fact that runs are 2 hours long also creates a larger \"exploration vs. exploitation\" dilemma. If you're an hour+ into a run, how likely are you to switch weapons?This is an especially big problem in an easier game - if I'm in the late game in my first few runs, I have absolutely no idea what each weapon or item does. So let's say I can spend 50% of my money on a new weapon that I've never seen. Or I can spend 70% on a permanent upgrade. I doubt most of us would buy the weapon. Even if the upgrade isn't too significant (which they really are not, in this game), buying the weapon doesn't guarantee a benefit. There's a good chance you've just thrown away a good deal of money.If the game was harder and shorter this wouldn't be a problem. You die more and earlier, you don't get as attached to your current loadout, you're more free to experiment until you find what works.Instead, most of the time, I preferred to stick with my gun that I know works well enough, versus a gun I have no idea about.There is another bad choice that makes the problem worse: shops appear at the end of a level. Usually after you've killed everything in it. Even if you buy a gun, you can't really try it against an enemy at that point. There are no weapon stats (visible to you, anyway). So, even when I do buy a new gun, I can only shoot it against a wall before deciding whether to stick with it or to get my old weapon back. This lack of information is an additional point against experimentation.______Another big problem with the game is the upgrade system. You can get higher rate of fire, damage, health, vision radius, movement speed, or some cheaper, \"gimmicky\" accessories like a coin magnet, a compass, an enemy scanner or a targetting laser.The problem is that upgrades are very expensive and seem to have very little effect (at least in the early game?). I'd rather have more expensive upgrades and more spread out, but ones that felt significant.But the biggest problem with these is that they're simply not interesting. They're very, very bland, and that's unfortunate.Especially when the game has a very cool visibility system! Around which they could have built unique upgrades that you wouldn't see in any other game.Put simply, you can only see if front of you, and walls block your sight. While that is very simple, it can make you play very carefully. The enemies also blend in with the walls a bit, though I think that's intentional.Some enemies can also dig into the ground.All of these things could give you qualitatively different upgrades. Maybe an underground scanner. Maybe a throwable camera that extends your vision to where you throw it. The game could be built around visibility, since it's its unique aspect! Instead, visiblity is mostly a side thing in the player's mind, since you can't do much about it.----There are too many similar weapons that seem like a combination of effects or stats. Too many weapons that, as I said, you're unlikely to experiment with.They could have gone with a modular gun system. Bouncy bullets, lasers, knockback, damage, speed, explosives, etc. etc.have gun modules might have been more interesting. Which you could then upgrade is a wider way that the bland stat upgrades currently in the game.----Finally, the camera is always centered on the character. This is very, very annoying.Most top down games have some degree of freedom regarding the camera. By moving the mouse to the edge of the screen, the camera moves accordingly. This would have made the game significantly better, I fell, especially in a game with such a focus on visibility!Enemies don't shoot while off screen, but when they suddenly appear in front of it, they can be far too close for a good reaction time.This is annoying when I clear an area, so I know my back is safe. Then, I would have liked to have more visibility in front, where I know there are enemies! But not such luck. This is the most objective point I can make about the game, I think. There is no way in which a centered camera can be a good design decision in my mind, for this game.----Anyway. I've talked about a bunch of problems. But I still enjoyed the game!And will probably play a bit more of it. Hence the positive rating. It won't rock your world, but it looks good, and I really like the music.Again, the upgrade system and the rogue-lite structure are not very good. But if you want some mindless shooting, this game will give you that!You can shoot down some projectiles, there are very different enemy types that force you to play just differently enough to be interesting.The core game is good! It's just the additional systems that don't fit together, in my opinion.",

        "text": "You're 90% at the mercy of the game's RNG.In survival games, you typically go look for whatever you need, experiment, etc.In this one, you're in a little raft and some locations pop-up near you, where you'll find supplies. These, as far as I can see, are completely random (with a different distribution in each area or the game, but still outside of your control). Which means that you don't really plan much, at least in the crafting aspect of the game.I'm only playing on \"Easy\" mode (which really is easy, but I also have no wish to play the harder modes, since I don't see how it could get better with the very little that the game has). This was the recommended for new players.The survival part is almost removed from this game. I died a couple of times at the start, mostly because I had no idea what each item did or where to find it. Once I figured things out, the game got very easy.That's fine, that's what other modes are there for, and it did teach me the way around the game!The problem is the crafting. You want to craft the higher level stuff. But for this, you need a bunch of tools, which break, and then require other materials, etc.And, as I mentioned at the start, there is no way that you can go look for whichever materials you need. If they happen to fall your way, great! If not... well, keep going until you find something.I don't play many survival games, but this doesn't very a good design decision at all. I'd like to explore a map to figure out where I can find things, and then try to gather the ones I need. Instead, I'm constantly doing some awkward (and sometimes buggy) inventory management because I need to change what I'm looking for based on what I'm given.The game seemed to have a nice setting, but there's barely no story here. Almost no characters, etc.Seemed like a cool game, but I don't like it after playing it for a few hours.There's a very small amount of items, and the only reason they take time to craft is because the game decides not to give you material X for a an area (which takes maybe an hour to complete), and then material Y, and so on. So, in the end, I have an inventory full of \"high level\" Bear Hides, but I can't do anything because I'm lacking \"low level\" rabbit hides, or flints, or something else.There's very little player input in this game. You're spoon fed (whether you like it or not) everything and you're supposed to play with what you're given. Not really my thing.P.S.(1): The difficulty also seems to grow in a very unnatural game, given the setting.You see more and more wolves or bears basically everywhere, despite the fact that the areas are the same as the ones you visited before. The rains also start occurring almost all the time, which is annoying (no rabbits, you get wet, can't light fires, etc.). I realize this is a game about a flood. That's fine. The problem is that it didn't start with a lot of rain. The rain increased to make the game more difficult later on. But... it doesn't feel right. The game isn't about overcoming rain. The rain is a generic difficulty barrier.P.S.(2): The interface has some bugs and many other overlooks that make the overall experience much worse than it should. Scrolling through the menus isn't fluid, sometimes the slected inventory item teleports to something else, etc.There's also the fact that you can craft either 1 or ALL (all for which you have materials) of a given item. These take exactly the same time. But you can't craft 2 or 3. If you want 4 instead of 6, you have to click, wait for the bar to fill, click, wait for the bar to fill, click, wait for the bar.... you get the point. All of these interface things pile up in a game that's a looot about inventory management and using the crafting menu.I could understand in a small game that wanted to pass a message instead of focusing on the user experience. But this is not that. The game is extremely padded (it's very repetitive with no good reason other than to justify its price), and it seems to say very, very little.",

        "text": "It's basically Assassin's Creed with a different layer of paintThe combat is really fun. Not very skill based, but very satisfying.Not much to the game from a higher level - it's a icon hunting trip. You go around the map completing far too many slight variations of the 4 or 5 basic mission types. The ending is a joke (the boss was 3 or 4 button presses...), and there isn't much to the story.The Nemesis system is the only thing that makes this game somewhat different, but it's still a very superficial system. There is no real strategy in choosing who or how to kill once you're good enough at the combat (which isn't hard).There is intrigue in the system, but you never really need to use it, so...Maybe the next game will be more fleshed out, because this is just an excuse to fight many, many battles. Gets rather repetitive, but I really enjoyed the combat, so there's that. Extra campaigns took 5 to complete, but they don't add much to the game. More of the same. A bit of a different focus on the missions, since they force you to use mechanics that you might have overlooked in the main campaign.It's a satisfying game to play, but it won't stay in your mind after you're done with it. Fun combat, empty game.",

        "text": "This might be one of the best shoot 'em up games out there.I didn't expect having as much fun with this as I did, but something about it seems to hit exactly the right spots in this genre!It's basically Pang. Although I didn't know about Pang, I had played a rip-off game from Miniclip many years ago called Bubble Trouble.Basically, you can only shoot up, and large enemies split into smaller enemies.  Pang didn't have a gun, but a hook that would disappear once it hit an enemy or the ceiling, and enemies would die even by hitting the hook's \"trail\". In this sense, The Bug Catcher is more traditional, i.e. you have an actual gun that functions like one - although you can only shoot vertically.The core gameplay is just really fun! But I would also say that the developers structured the game very nicely.The core gameplay is basically predicting the enemies' arc movements to avoid them, while clearing the screen. This requires quite a lot of focus, but it's very satisfying. I'm focusing on the single-player missions. There is also an Endless both, both for single player and for co-op. (I actually didn't enjoy co-op very much. But I usually don't anyway? I like to concentrate on the game I'm playing and that doesn't work very well with other people, but maybe that's just me...)The levels are a mixture of reflex and memorization, if you're going for all the objectives. Each level has 3 stars for score, and an additional objective to hit a X-combo. Your combo meter is incremented every time you kill an enemy, but it's reset when you don't kill any enemy for 4-6 seconds.I think this is the part that made the game so enjoyable for me. Because in every level, you're trying to figure out the order in which to kill the enemies so that you don't lose your combo, and maximizing your score as a result. A higher combo gives you a higher score, exponentially (it seemed).There are 5 areas. They play similarly, but each one has a different environmental hazard. One has a hammer that comes down in the center of the room, from time to time, another has breakable (and respawnable) platforms at some height, etc.Each area has 6 levels, the 6th being a special elevator level that introduces some tougher enemies - minibosses, if you will - that will appear later in the game.So, 30 levels in total, which took me maybe 7-7.5 hours to master. All objectives on every level. I often get frustrated when going for these \"perfect\" scores in most game, but not on this one. The whole time, I was focused enough and enjoying myself the whole time. That very rarely happens.So yeah, I don't know exactly why, but this game is really, really, good. The modes designed seem to bring the best out of the core gameplay.There are also temporary guns and powerups, which are good to give some variety to repeated retries. Temporary invincibility, freeze enemies, etc. The weapons are usually better screen clearers than your basic weapon.You upgrade all of this, although the upgrade system is fairly shallow.Not much weapon or power-up variety, but I honestly think it doesn't need it. The core game is that satisfying that it doesn't need much dressing up.Not as descriptive as most of my reviews, I guess. But I don't think there's much to describe, here. The game isn't very original - mostly a derivative of Pang with some modern aspects. Yet, it works. Really well!So yeah, definitely give it a go if the game seems up your alley. Won't change your world, but you'll probably have a great time, knowing what game to expect!",

        "text": "Heh. This is a lemmings-like game that seemed to have some cool ideas.But it's all over the place, in mechanics, level-design, and difficulty. These are related, but I have specific problems with each overall area.The problem in the mechanics is that only some are physics driven. This makes puzzles very messy, at times. Instead of being certain of an elegant solution, you may get stuck in a dead end, because the current setup is almost a solution, and you're lost in many slight variations, hoping chaos will solve the situation.The problem in level design is, in part, derived from those very mechanics. The levels seem all over the place. Some have very specific, discrete ways of placing the items, thus becomes an exercise in logic. Others, however, use the physics in a chaotic way that's difficult to predict - a replicate, when timing is involved.A new items is also introduced every 3 or 6 levels. So things move very fast, and no idea has any time to setup interesting problems. Some of the levels are too easy because they're just introducing an item, and once those are gone, you have a new item in front of you.Finally, also related to the previous, is difficulty.There are 4 sets of basic levels, plus a 5th that you slowly unlock as you beat the other levels.The 4th set is supposedly the last \"canonic\" one. It's also, by far, the easiest. The first level of the 5th set is also the hardest one in the game (judging from my experience and also forum posts). This isn't quite true - however, it relies on a very specific placement of an item. I actually tried that (before looking up the solution), but it apparent was very slightly off place (it wasn't clear at all, visually), and the game didn't recognize it. This is a big problem.I think this game was made mostly for the workshop. The levels never settle into a specific line of thinking, there are too many items, etc.It would make sense for all of this to be explored in user-made levels, but the designed set of levels isn't very good at all, in my opinion.One achievement is very cool. Because it forces you to setup a level (with the level editor) in a certain way. I'm not sure if this was just to suggest people to try the workshop levels. But there could be an interesting metagame here if there were more achievements of this type.Given Klei's track record, this game is rather unexpected. Even the artstyle seems very generic (contrast it with the more unique Eets game, which, I think, was this game's predecessor).So yeah, I wouldn't suggest this one. Maybe the workshop levels could be good.",

        "text": "This game mostly reminded me of just how good Mark of the Ninja is.RONIN's appeal is definitely its style. Also, how the real-time vs. turn-based gameplay is depicted, makes it seem a very innovative game... until you play it, and then realize it's actually just turn-based, except it doesn't work all the time.The overall impression of the game I get is how at least 80% of the deaths aren't really the player's fault - this is a point often mentioned when talking about games, but it seems especially applicable to RONIN.While the core game is solid (though, again, when thinking about Mark of the Ninja, you realize how little RONIN actually does - RONIN is almost a small subset of Mark of the Ninja), the game has a bunch of interface/control issues (actual issues, not minor inconveniences) that the developer acknowledges in the game's hints, but didn't bother to fix.These problems go from unintuitive controls to the very important missdirections - that is, the interface tells you x will happen, but y happens instead. Also related to these is the fact that the interface doesn't give all the predictive information you need.The most unique part about the game is that enemies behave in a turn based fashion - one turn to aim (with a visible laser), and a second to shoot, for the basic enemies - you then plan your actions to jump in the safe place between bullets, then throwing your sword into a enemy and using a grappling hook to swing to the ceiling, etc. etc.The idea is very cool, and sometimes works! Most of the time, though, you'll be playing a stealth game, and hoping that the controls don't malfunction, having to replay sections over and over again.The problem is that you have a jumping arc that's supposed to tell you what happens to the character. But sometimes, the character gets stuck in a platform, despite the interface not showing that. It also doesn't show if you'll be in the line of fire or not - you'll have to guess at the hitboxes. There's also a problem in the teleporting, where it isn't clear where the character will land. For the same enemy, near a ledge, sometimes that character ends up on the platformer, other times hanging from it.Hanging is also a biiiig problem. So, the game has elements of real-time and turn-based. This is only half true. Real-time only works when no enemy has detected you. This is very annoying at times, because to kill enemies, you have to click an icon above their heads, which isn't plausible in real-time, with the camera moving. Unfortunately, turn-based actions only active after being seen, which doesn't help the stealth.Finally, you can't really run or climb in turn-based mode, since those are inherently real-time aspects. But then, if you are hanging from a ledge in turn-based move, you can't actually climb the ledge. Instead, you have to jump outwards, and then use another 2 turns to throw the grappling hook and then pull yourself towards the platform. This is incredibly annoying, since jumping outward usually means jumping into enemies' line of fire.Another player described it as \"hop around like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 cricket\". That pretty much sums it up. His review actually describes my frustrating moments with the game perfectly. It really is rage inducing, when you expect something to work in a logical way, but then the game doesn't work as it should and you end up dying.One thing the is also annoying is that enemies don't have friendly fire. The hard sections of the game involve shootouts that would absolutely tear the enemy force if there was. This is a more personal gripe with the game's mechanics rather than the game itself.The mechanics provide a set of challenges and that's fine, although a satisfying aspect of a game's design is also how the mechanics related to the world (real or fictional)... anyway.2 more issues with the game.The last level has no checkpoint and no additional objectives, which very strongly differs from the whole game that came before. I'd rather have a final level that uses the previously used mechanics in a more difficult way, but no. The lack of checkpoints (even after you're 100% safe) is a huge negative, because (1) the game doesn't \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 work, and (2) you'll be forced to repeat completely predictable sections, only to get screwed over in the same later section.Final issue is new game plus. It's cool that it exists, but it adds 2 random elements in a game that requires precision. Only of them is that some enemies spray their bullets, thus widening their line of fire. That's fine.The bigger problem is that some of the spawned enemies are random, between a basic, easy enemy, and these spreading, 2 turn firing enemies. The latter are much, much harder, and each restart presents you with different puzzles, essentially. 75% of the enemies are the same in both restarts, and so is their placement, so it's not like a rogue-lite mode or whatever you want to call it. It's just a little bit of randomness that makes successive restarts unbalanced.Oh well. That's all I've had problems with, I think.The structure of the game was pretty good. There are 5 chapters with 3 levels each. I played each chapter in one sitting and that was the perfect length for me.When you manage to pull off some of the intended actions, you feel like a badass as well, and the core loop of the game is very satisfying when it works. Which is seldom.So yeah. It could be much better than it is. As is, it's a less ambitious/encompassing version of Mark of the Ninja, which also doesn't really work.Almost good. Almost.",

        "text": "GoNNER is a solid game, but I think it chose the wrong structure/genre.The rogue-like structure is usually a way of exploring a space of possibilities more thoroughly. Instead of a small subset of situations (as in puzzle games), rogue-likes have a specific set of rules, and then place you in as many combinations of those as possible.This can include both challenges that you have to overcome, and the tools at your disposal to do so.I usually use The Binding of Isaac as an example, especially of the second point. You have a whole lot of items, and a whole lot of synergies between them. So the rogue-like structure is great to show you the different permutations. It also has a lot of subtleties to explore and later exploit - from secret rooms, to arcades, to interactions between items that give you consumables, etc.You're also very dependent on the items that you get, though you also have some control over the number of items and choices you have to shape your run.GoNNER works on a very different principle: you can carry only 3 different items at once, and all of them are available at the start of the game (assuming you've unlocked them). There are <10 items in each category.What this means is that, after an initial period of experimentation, you've probably chosen your favourite combination, and there's little reason to stray from it.The game has you going for a set of 4 (and a half, let's say) levels in each area, then you get a shop, followed by a Boss. Each different area obeys this structure.These shops sell you HP (though one of your items determines your max HP, so you can only refill it in the shops), ammo, and some of the other items (randomly chosen, though you can pay for rerolls).Now, why would you use the shops at all, given you have your chosen loadout from the start? The most obvious choice is if you like to handle each area differently. That's fine, though that wasn't the case for me - one of the loadouts was clearly better in every aspect, for my playstyle.The other situation in which they can be useful, is if you've lost some item. When you're hit, all your items are scattered, and you can to recollect them. They're usually scattered close to you, but some of the areas make it difficult to get your items back - one has lots of pits that lead to death, another has a very clear directionality, so it's difficult to go back to retrieve them, etc.Unfortunately, it was very rare for this to happen without leading to my permanent death. Because you only have 3 items, it's a huge handicap to lose one. Also, the game is very fast, you die very easily, but can also quickly get far in the game. Also, if you have collected enough glyphs (currency), you can restart the level at which you were on (die at area X, level Y, you restart at area X, level Y, so you don't really lose progress). This is means that you can easily forfeit a life to get those items back (usually once per game at most, but still).From this, I hope it's clear that you aren't really encouraged to experiment with loadouts during the game. There is neither enough variety, nor are there enough constraints. Once you stabilize on your optimal, you have little reason to abandon it.The other aspect would be exposing you to different challenges. This isn't really ideal in a platformer/shooter, though. Enemies only interact with you can close range, unless they shoot randomly from afar. So your best bet is to take care of enemies from afar as well. This doesn't expose you to many different challenges, and each run goes more or less the same way.Finally, and this is the only benefit this game gets from being a rogue-like, comes mechanical mastery. Basically, you get better at the game - not very surprising, heh?You get used to the jumping suubtleties, the gun knockback, how enemies move, jumping on top of enemies, etc. You slowly master all of these aspects until you can beat the game.For me, this isn't really enough to warrant the game's structure. The perma-death, especially. Thankfully, the game is very fast paced (in both ways - you can die very easily, but you can quickly get back to where you were). But it's still very annoying to die late in the game, and having to go through all of the rest because of a small mistake. Or, even worse, is the fact that the bosses are much, much harder than the rest of the game. The last boss is especially chaotic. So you repeatedly go through the easy areas until you die to the last boss again.There are other aspects of the game that I didn't think were too good.The glyphs you collect have a cap. Also, because the shop isn't very useful, you often each this cap early on. So, their only use is almost as a second life (which gets more expensive the later you die, being very close to the cap later in the game). This means that the early game is mostly inconsequential - playing perfectly on bosses can give you more ammo, but that is also undone when you use your second life, or lose your weapon, so it's rarely significant. All in all, this is a very purist game. It's 95% mechanical skill, at most 5% of exploiting the game's secrets, shops, etc.This makes the rogue-like formula seem a bit scummy - favours the idea the perma-death is in the game as an artificial extension to the game's length.If you really enjoy purist games, you can probably enjoy this a lot! The items are genuinely distinct from one another, and so require changes in your play style to use the different combinations.You can make a challenge for yourself to beat the game with the different combinations, try to reach for higher combos/scores, etc.But I do think the game is very difficult for most people to get much out of it. I took 12 hours to beat it for the first time, after reaching the final boss maybe 5 or 6 times. Once I managed to beat it, I had enough of it, honestly.----Ok, I wrote a lot of stuff I thought was wrong with the game. It had mostly to do with its structure. That aside, I think GoNNER is very solid! As I said, the items are very different, and there are many subtleties to the movement, from the knockback, to enemy explosions, to jump height.So it's a good game, but I strongly disagree with its overall focus.The game Bleed seems better structured for something of this type - many difficulties to choose from, focus on time/score, much better suited for multiple playthroughs and getting better at it with each one.GoNNER seems a war of attrition, slowly getting better at exactly the same thing until you beat it.That aside, the game has a very unique style, both visually and musically. Both of these also change and get more chaotic with your combo meter.Anyway, I've ranted for long enough.I think the game's \"rogue-like\" aspect is a product of the times more so than a design decision, and it ends up feeling very out of place, and even artifically extending the game's length.But, if you enjoy mastering the details of a runner/shooter game, you can probably get quite a lot out of this. It's just not what it seems to encourage, so the burden is on the player, so to speak. ",

        "text": "EDIT2: (first is at the end) Despite of how I talk about the controls (negatively), I the character movement is nuanced and feels good! It's just the pick-up method that is akward, but it's otherwise very good.________________End of edit 2_______________( The game itself seems alright. I like the look of it, and the music is also pretty good! )The controls are a bit annoying. Which is a bit of a feat given their simplicity. The problem is this: you have to pick things up. The developer mapped it to the \"Down\" button. The controls are rebindable, but pick-up is always the same as down. It could be fine, but no: this is a speedrunning game (a bit too forceful in that regard too), so your constantly incentivized to optimize all the little actions at all times. As is it, I'd like to pick things up without having to move the movement analog. It's just awkward. And it's not like there aren't extra buttons for it. On a controller, I think I only use the analog and 2 other buttons (jump and throw). It's a detail, sure. But in a game that right from the first level is pushing you toward golden (and beyond) medals for speed, it's a detail that comes right into the vanguard. I'll probably update the review if I have anything relevant to say. As the previous reviewer wrote, the game really pushes you into the speedrunning side of things. It's not Super Meat Boy (so far) in that the game itself is difficult and challenging, but after (or while) mastering it, you find the fastest paths, etc.In here, the levels are fairly easy (at the start, at least), but also rather straightforward. The speed isn't as much in finding the right path as much as timing jumps (it's a pressing-time sensitive jump) and throws.So beware. If you don't want a game that pushes time optimization, probably good to look elsewhere. Sure, you can ignore the timers, but the game seems very focused on the time, so there's that.______________________________________Update:Ok, I've \"finished it, now\". Well, not really, but for my purposes. I've finished the main 100 levels, all with Golden Flowers (beat the time limit). This unlocks another 10 levels. If you really, really like Speedrunning, you can try to beat the Dev's time (<=) for the Rainbow flowers (which I didn't pursue and only got on a few levels (<10)), which grants you another 10 levels for a total of 120.These last 20 levels are far, far harder than the other 100. In a way, I really like it. In another, not really.The main 100 levels are rather bland. Completing these levels is never an issue, they aren't very interesting. Their value is mostly in beating the time. Most of the time, it comes down to optimizing the small movements to an infuriating level. Occasionally, though, it's about the subtle techniques that could make this game awesome!Warning: this section probably makes no sense to people who haven't played the game (or at least aren't familiar with speedrunning platformers, in which I assume these subtleties are commonplace).There was one level, for example, with a long, narrow, horizontal corridor. There were also pursuers that killed you on contact. Given the normal mechanics, if you tried to go through it, the pursuers would catch you. If you took a detour to attract the pursuers somewhere else, though, your time would be much higher than the target. This large interval in the times is important, because it suggests there is a way to get through the corridor faster, since that's the only plausible way to get the golden flower.Through it, I discovered you get a speedup when jumping - and, I believe, a speeddown when falling. Because the ceiling cancels the falling speed-down, spamming jumps in that corridor will make you go a bit faster - enough to get through the corridor in time!Another level had to do with jumping while carrying offspring. These slow you down, and lower your jump height. One level, though, had a golden time of 1 second. The \"normal\" way of doing it was 10 or 20 seconds. Again, this huge difference is important.The trick was to jump before grabbing the offspring, and grab it in the air, without reducing the jump height and managing to go over a platform that would otherwise be too high.These things were very interesting, to me! I'm not too into speedrunning, so I'm not used to these subtle mechanics.Unfortunately, the main game barely uses them, and also teaches them way too late in the game.Maybe they're useful for beating the dev's times, but very rarely do they help in getting the golden flowers.The point is that the game could have been much more interesting if the levels relied on these more than they do. Because, as it stands, the levels are not noteworthy at all (with some exceptions). It's mostly filler with a very narrow window for innefficiencies to get the gold medals.The last levels go the complete other way. They rely on most of these techniques, but also with a very precise timing and familiarity with the game's controls (which I've mentioned I didn't really like) to even finish.It really lacks the middle ground, in my opinion. I'll leave it as positive because the game isn't really bad at all. But I didn't enjoy most of my time with it. The fact that just finishing the levels wasn't challenging or rewarding at all created a huge pressure to finish the game within the specified time. This something requires incredibly precise timing on most of the low level activities instead of clever paths and subtle techniques.Despite that, I really like the look of the game (very nice choice of colors and shading!) and the music was quite alright too.I'd advise to get it only if you're into the speedrunning. As a more general-purpose platformer, it's probably not a good choice.",

This causes their trust to increase or decrease.The characters are very very stereotypical with no depth at all, so far. \"Your\" character is expected to act like said stereotype to get the positive responses as well, so there isn't much room to choose what to say. The general tone of the writing is \"Guns blazing, oh look a sexy woman (want some?), machines have no life despite behaving exactly like humans\".There is something interesting underneath, theme-wise, but I have my doubts that the game will go in that direction.I'll keep updating this review as I play.Edit (after finishing the game; full of spoilers, starting with a spoiler of the major twist, so stay clear): Ok, there was one cool aspect of the story. The rest, was very much in the vein of the things I've mentioned at the start, and completely ignoring the problems and themes that seems to be the game's base.  Ok, remember the sexy woman thing? Well, of course, the sexy woman falls in love with the loud, strong, american guy that also happens to be the player. In a rather cliched mission where the two fight together, one gets hurt to save the other, intimate moment involving first aids, etc.Then, the big spoiler is that she turns out to be a robot as well (unknowingly) so big drama. Up to this point, every robot was treated as something completely devoid of value, killed because of orders. Despite the fact that they were, in every exterior aspect, human. They thought and felt like humans, but because they were robots, they were shot.All of a sudden, when the sexy woman turns out to be a robot, and loved by the main character, things somehow change and now she's worth saving? At the same time, the big \"bad\" ai still deserves to be killed.Then, there's a very weird thing about the story. That's that the female robots can mate with humans and actually have biological children. But the children, despite having no mechanical parts, are still considered robots. And are faster, smarter, stronger, etc. than normal humans for no reason. The big bad AI's objective is to create this robot-human hybrid race that is better than humans... despite the fact that the \"robot\" is only the first mother. This is the murky part, since it's never explained how the robots and the humans merge. I guess it's a fact to be \"accepted\". But since it's a very, very dubious \"fact\", I find it hard to follow the logic the there. At some point, everything becomes plausible.The interesting aspect was on a more conceptual level, but it was also very short. It was that the bad AI was created to emulate humans on the level of emotions. As a result, it acts humanly, fearing for its own life. It's fairly logical. Unfortunately, its use was really just as the origin for the antagonist...The story keeps on the track of military guys shooting everything in sight and making emotional decisions based on power alone. \"I have the bigger gun, so I decide what happens\".In the end, the game's story is simply \"Robots are indistinguishable from humans, so they're bad and should be exterminated. Wait, there's a sexy woman that's also a robot, but she can't be bad because I love her, so protect her, but continue killing the other robots. Team mates are initially against the sexy woman robot, but for some reason change their minds (unspokenly, by the way) when someone from the government betrays them.The question of whether the robots in general should be killed is never addressed, which boggles my mind. When these are completely indistinguishable, it seems a very natural question, but the game just assumes that they're all cannon fodder, with the ocasional dramatic moment when they discover they're robots and panic.There was also an interesting (thought not good, in my opinion) section of the game where you're killing prototypes of these human-like robots. These act like zombies, being weak and trying to swarm you just like a zombie mob. These are supposed to be the human-like prototypes, yet they act far more mindlessly than the other robots you shoot that are very... robotic, without the human-like pretense. It's just weird.It seems a bit of a justification for killing the robots that are supposedly so close to humans. By making them more mindless, they avoid the question I mentioned before, maybe? Heh, there isn't really a single reasoning thread in what I wrote. It's just a bunch of stuff that I found (mostly) wrong in the story and completely missed the points it seemed to aim for.I found the controls and combat rather awkward as well, but I admit I was playing this one mainly for the story.So yeah. I came with an open mind (but perhaps higher expectations than most would), but didn't find much worth seeingin almost any aspect. It's an okay game with, in my opinion, pretty bad writing. Well, maybe the writing isn't actually bad, but aiming for something else (a rather crude/not-subtle \"love\" story) with the pretense of a science fiction story. I'll settle for bad.",

        "text": "The game is pretty fun while you're learning, but it gets very repetitive after you have a viable strategy (and the campaign does extend a bit too long in this regard, with very little significant additions).If you like resource management games (and RTS with a focus on building rather than combat), you'll probably enjoy this. I had a good time, for a while.The problem I have with it came later, in the Expert campaign. It's basically the exact same thing, but with much tougher opponents.It started out fine, but things turned sour later on. This would be all fine, except that the game is a huge snowball. If you lose pace, you've lost. Especially at the end, when the opponents are incredibly good and pile up much more money than you do, unless you have a really good strategy.Basically, you go through a sequence of levels. You start levels by setting up your oil pumps, carrying horses, etc. You have a fixed amount of money to do this (2000\u20ac), but can enter debt if you run out of it.The interest in these levels is that 1) you have to find the oil and 2) you spend money to build everything. So you're trying to minimize your spendings on both finding and then extracting the oil. You'll use the money you make on the level to buy upgrades, choosing land, getting some discounts and, later, shares (end-game).This makes every level influence the future ones, hence the snowball.The problem with this is that it really discourages experimentation. It's very risky to try out a new mechanic the game introduces. 1) because you have to buy pretty expensive upgrades to take advantage of them and 2) because you don't know how they work. So you're basically spending a lot of money on the possibility of taking advantage of a mechanic, and then have to play some levels very sub-optimally to figure out how the mechanics actually work. Since the game is a race from beginning to end, the risk/incentive to explore is far too high.These are actually 2 problems. In Normal mode, the game if fairly easy, and you can easily dominate the AI by not taking risks. In this case, it lacks incentive.In Expert mode, they're so close to you that you would be shooting yourself in the foot by experimenting with the mechanics. It's too risky!So yeah... Expert Mode was being harder, but close for a while. Then, when I was almost winning, the AI suddenly got incredibly good (probably by taking advantage of the new mechanics I didn't know how to use) and got to far ahead of me to do anything.This wasn't at all what I expected. And, in a way, it's good that this happens! On the other hand, there are the problems above, where the game never presents the right opportunities for you to react to it. In Normal mode, most of the mechanics ended up ignored. In Expert mode, you were expected to have mastered them. Without the space in-between.If you are aware of this, you will probably be able to take advantage of the normal campaign to experiment. If not, well... oops.I definitely think the game should encourage the player to try the new mechanics, even in a sandbox type of mode. But it needs to alert you to do, due to the snowball effect. If it's too late when you realize your mistakes, nothing will change.This is all a problem because the campaign is several hours long. If it was 1 hour or so, you could experiment during the campaign. Since it's at least 3 or 4, this doesn't really work.Anyway, that's it for my problems with the game.Now, for the things I've found really interesting!Between levels, you can buy upgrades, get discounts, etc. which is fairly generic, but you also have to select the land for the next level.The map is divided into cells (though not a regular grid), in which every player (well, you and the NPCs) can bid for a given land. You can pay more to taken someone's land and this can happen quite a few times.You don't know the value of each land, but you can get an idea by looking at the adjacent lands that have already been played by you or the NPCs. So, basically, you're trying to balance how much you spend (compared to the others)with how much you think the land is worth! Pretty cool!Building on this auction idea, in the end-game, you have to buy shares to become mayor of the town. Once again, every player wants to buy the shares, but the auction works differently: this time, the price goes down, and not up. But the first bidder gets the share.This is, again, really cool! I'd actually be more interested in seeing this game being played by real people (if the campaign were shortened, I guess).Since the price starts too high, everyone is trying to guess when other players will go for the share. Go too early and you spend too much on too little shares... wait too long and you've lost them!I've actually come across auction related game theory in a class (just an overview, nothing very deep), so I'm probably finding this much more interested than anyone else (and myself at any other time, probably?...).Still, it's a nice set of diversions to the main game that don't feel like pure filler. It's an interesting and real mini-game, in a sense.Anyway, that's about it. These auctions aren't as interesting against an AI since you can more or less exploit them in subsequent playthroughs. So a multiplayer mode with a shorter, more focused campaign would be cool.If any of this sounds like up your alley, give it a go! It certainly has some unique ideas (to the extent that I never saw them in other games, anyway...) and is fun for a while regardless of its missteps. ",

        "text": "This game caught my attention a while ago, mostly because of the lore, but also because of its unique artstyle.Having finished the main content, now, I'm not too impressed, but it's not all faults!The game is essentially a boss-rush type of experience. Except the rush part. Instead, you're forced through different levels between boss fights, to collect \"runes\". You have a central hub with 5 different Jotun to defeat. The first one is fixed, as the introduction to the game. The other 4 you're free to tackle in any order you please. To open the Jotun's gate, you need to collect 2 runes. Each Boss has 2 distinct areas (levels), each with one rune for you to collect. There is also one HP upgrade and one skill in each area.Each level will have a different \"mechanic\". However, they're very simple, so calling them \"mechanics\" is pushing it a bit.For example, in one level you'll have to hit certain marked trees to create bridges. In another you'll have to taunt enemies into throwing rocks at you, which you can then hit into the lava to... create bridges, once again. Now that I'm writing this I realize that there are lots of bridges in the game. They're not very important though, except as gates. Anyway...The game does an okay job of teaching you how each level works by starting you off with simple examples. Unfortunately, the levels aren't very interesting. It's just about walking until you find the rune, without much else going on in those. The reason for this is that your character doesn't do much. You can walk around, do a light attack, and a heavy attack. Also, roll! That's important. Now imagine that every action had an additional \"heavy\" modifier. That's how it works. Everything is very slow (intentionally so, I assume). While that isn't a negative, necessarilly, it does make the levels feel like a drag. Especially the running speed, since each area is fairly big and also fairly empty, you'll get tired to just walking around very quickly.I'll talk about combat later.The character also has skills. These include healing, a speed boost, spear throw, etc. You can only use each twice, unless you find a checkpoint to replenish your health and skill points. These abilities are completely fine in the context of the boss fights. In the levels, however, they're mostly useless. And I have to say the speed boost would have been very welcome (to battle tedium)! Unfortunately, since you have maybe 5-10 seconds of a slight boost, twice, it's rather useless. Healing was the only usefull skill in the levels, honestly.Ok, here's a cool idea, but that ended up being very superficial and not very good in the end. You have a map for the levels. A \"real\" map. Not a GPS, but a semi-fixed thing. You don't know exactly where you are, but you can deduce it (you know where you start) by the paths you've taken or some landmarks. This is cool! Not many games require you to read a map. Unfortunately, it's rather awkward, in this game. There aren't real landmarks, except the checkpoints, or the rune/skill locations that you can see on the map before you find them. The rest is an exercise in linking (bridging hehe) the bridges you see on the level with the ones of the map.The map isn't very useful, and not very acurate either. There are levels for which it is almost impossible to read the map, since the drawing doesn't really match the level.Heh. A bit of a missed opportunity, but hey...Now, let me talk about the artstyle. Again, the problem I have is in the levels. The perspective seems very off, to me. The art is also very flat coloured, which makes it difficult to figure out what ground is higher than another.The levels aren't built of game objects, as I've come to expect. Instead, they're like a drawing. Then, they add collisions with invisible objects that match the drawing. Well, in principle. I suppose this would be fine, except that it didn't seem very well made, to me. The hitboxes aren't very precise, and combined with the flatness and the perspective, things don't really connect very well.The screenshots aren't very revealing, but look at the game in action to see what I mean.Ok, so far, this is a bit too negative. It has also been all about the levels. And I think that's fair, since the levels seem to be mostly filler. Having the game consist of 6 boss fights probably seemed insufficient, so they added a bunch of level to stretch that game's length. That's mostly how it felt, to me. Again, they tried to keep things fresh with different mechanics per area, but then lost the opportunity to build upon anything, and the levels ended up very superficial and uninteresting.The artstyle, aside for the weird perspective and somewhat disfunctional aspects, is beautiful. Especially when they setup the scenes in parts of the levels, zooming it out quite a lot and showing a much vaster background than you could see before. That's cool. Not original, but they still look very cool! There are some scenes of this type throughout the levels, where you encounter some important animals to the mythology and whatnot.So there are pretty things to look at!The music is also fairly good. Well, fitting. It wasn't very memorable or anything, but it was good as a background thing.Nothing surprising, really, but I can't fault them too much for it.Ok, the main part of the game, now. The Jotun fights. This is very clearly the developer's idea for the game all along. The limited skill use, the slow attacks, etc. It was all to fight against the giants, not to run around fetching a rune for 20 minutes.How is it? Pretty good! Not as striking, perhaps, since the fights are shorter than the levels... It's unfortunate, since the impression I'm left it is mostly about the levels than the bosses.Each Boss is very different from one another, but all follow a multi-phased structure. They start off fairly forgiving, for you to learn their attacks, and then they start becoming meaner.I've seen people complain about impossible to dodge damage, but that's not true. You'll have to do some clutch dodges, most of the time, but you can avoid stuff!Some bosses were abit too easy, but others compensated for it by requiring very timely skill use to defeat them!The gameplay mostly revolves around... rolling. The heavy attack is a bit too slow to be reliable (although the bosses have appropriate pauses to let you use it), so you'll mostly be trying to do some damage to the boss between attack, and then rolling out of their huge attacks. Positioning and timing are everything, and this part of the game is cool, once you get the patterns down! Choosing when to use the abilities is also crucial.The game also has a \"Valhalla Mode\", which you unlock after beating the game. I guess it's a pure boss fight mode, in which they get stronger. Maybe I'll give it a shot later, but I didn't really feel like trying it right after beating the game.Ok, to finish this rambling thing, the best (?) part of the game: the lore and voice-acting. The game has 2 stories, more or less. One, is about your character and why you're doing what you're doing. It's okay, fitting, but not very inspiring. Two, much cooler, is about norse mythology. As you go through the levels, you'll see some creatures, followed by a short narration of what they are and their role in the mythology. One level in specific was far heavier in exposition, and it was much cooler than the rest. You won't learn a lot about the mythology through casually playing this game (since the levels are a bit too disjointed and these bits are quite spread apart), but it seems to convey the general ideas about the creation of the world pretty well!Finally, the voice-acting is awesome and I didn't understand a word of it. Well, maybe a couple. I'm not sure if it is Icelandic or Swedish or what, but it sounds really good, and makes the whole thing far more convincing than most game where you hear accented english. ",

        "text": "I really liked Tiny & Big: Granpa's Leftovers a while back (one of the few games that was very much like a collect-a-ton like SM64, yet had very modern mechanics, and gave you a lot of freedom which made exploring really satisfying!), and they also have a mobile game (about batteries?) that I found pretty cool. So I had my eye on this one and bought it on the winter sale.This game has a their distinct style all over, but especially in the music! It's great!The visuals are good as well, but more in style than impressiveness, I guess? They look a bit crude, but style makes up for it.Unfortunately, while I liked some of the game, I don't see a main purpose to it. The platforming feels good, and while the mechanics aren't completely original, that isn't a problem, if the levels make the game a beast of its own. But it didn't really seem the case, here.Difficulty-wise, it's very soft, for the most part. A couple challenging sections, perhaps, but nothing lasting. And the levels are way too short, mostly under 20 seconds long on your first try. When I play Super Meat Boy, I can end the levels very quickly. But that's because I have planned routes and lots of practice. In here, all of that seems almost given from the start, and the levels don't really have many different approaches. As I said, though, the mechanics aren't very original. So novelty is also limited. Since you stick to every wall (even at angles), there is some novelty to it (and I'll write more further in the review about this), but not enough to seem the meat of the experience at all.The story is also very barebones, told through panels spread through the levels (very stylish ones!) and some hidden rooms. But, again, not really the point.Finally, there are tokens spread around the levels, for you to find/collect. This was actually a very cool mechanic! Basically,  you needed a token to activate a checkpoint. But you'd lose it in the process. So it could make for some cool level design, where you had to \"assign\" tokens to choose the checkpoints carefully, perhaps.None of that happened (although it did provide some more challenge in the process). Here's what happened: I tried to collect every token in my first try. Since most levels are under 20 seconds, checkpoints aren't very important. So I tried to ignore all of them in the first go.In hindsight, this was a bit of a misuse of the mechanic, but hey... The upside was that some checkpoints required some finesse not to activate! If you touch them, you lose a token. So I was actually fighting against the checkpoints not to lose tokens! That was cool. But it happened rarely. So, again, it seemed like an accident in design more so than a deliberate choice? Or at least not a very determinate choice.From all of this rambling, I hope I've gotten the point across, somewhat. The game seems to have a few cool ideas, but they're only touched superficially. They never go all in and make a level where you have to take things into consideration. Instead, you mostly go through the motions for the whole game.Maybe I just wasn't in the right state of mind when I started this game, and so lacked the motivation to enjoy throughout, I don't know. But I think the point is valid.There are also other problems, structure/interface wise.Speedrunning seems encouraged, since you're given your leaderboard position at the end of the level. But you can't see other players' times (on the game), so the competition doesn't get very fierce.The token you collect in a level are also kept, even if you die. This means that some challenging sections are made much easier if you just collect the token and die, and then go through the easy path.Sometimes the game is rather unclear about its rules. etc. These are minor problems, but it seems to add up in the end. It's not quite there yet, as a great game, I think. Which surprised me, seeing all the praise in the other reviews. Maybe I'm wrong!If you like their style, give the game ago. It's not a bad game, it just seemed to fall short of being noteworthy.",

        "text": "The game is really, really beautiful, as you can see from the screenshots!Even though it looks a bit crude (looks jagged in movement, some patterns seem a bit flattened, etc.), there are tons of intricate patterns I really like!The music is a bit strange, with some details I enjoyed (the birds and bells, for example), but I wasn't aware of it, for the most part. So yeah, wasn't good nor bad, for me.The game itself is the worst part, since, despite a beautiful and rather large \"world\" (the game is short, it's only \"large\" in the context of a single room/level), it's just about jumping on platforms and using lifts to get to several tablets spread around the game. The platforming isn't challenging at all (you're quite slow in the air), and most of the jumps are very forgiving, giving you a fair window for error.There are no mechanics at all, other than a single jump.So yeah, you can imagine it being very stale. It's just about moving around, with the most basic movement system you could think of.The only challenge here is orientation, since the game only lets you see the map in specific spots, so you can get lost, or miss something and forgetting where it might have been.The other aspect I should mention is the whole \"Tibetan theology/philosophy\". I think what they wanted to say was \"imagery\", because there's nothing meaningful about philosophy or theology here. And nothing apparently that relates to a particular way of thinking.There are some cryptic lines spread around the game, but you never have to use or understand them. So... no.Maybe there are some environmental clues I'm missing? Maybe... but even if there are, they're completely isolated from the *game*, making them irrelevant.If it was just about imagery, well... they should set different expectations in the description, I guess.The game isn't too bad, and it's free, so nothing's stopping you from giving you a go. I just didn't find anything interesting in it aside from the art-style, so I'll give it a no.I'm interested in their future projects regardless! With more experience, something better may come!",

        "text": "This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be \"surprising\", in some way, reaching escape velocity from \"generic platformer\".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!",

        "text": "Beautiful game. Very unique style that, for the most part, works well with the game, conveying cones of vision and cover/shadows well (with some exceptions).The music sounded really nice, but I can't say I like that way it was implemented into the game. A suddenly epic \"thump\" when you get sighted is completely out of touch with the rest of the music, and gets very repetitive as you play along... Didn't help with the flow at all, in my opinion, quite the contrary.Ok, the game itself. Not a fan either... A big part of that may be because I just decided to try it, without any motivation to do so. That said, what I saw didn't seem particularly impressive or original. The game itself is solid, mechanically. You have a wide array of different gadgets that I can imagine being put into creative use. Some of them. The biggest problem is how the game compartmentalizes them into sets of levels/obstacles.The game is incredibly linear in 2 different levels: how you simply go through 100 levels, one after another; how each level itself is very linear, consisting of going around it collecting gems to open the exit, and then reaching the exit. There are \"lore\" pieces throughout, but these follow the same linear path as the gems do. They don't provide an extra layer of challenge or detours.Back to the creative use of gadgets. As the levels are very linear, the game gives you some levels with gadget X, and then moves on to Y. Then to Z, etc. They don't really overlap (with very few exceptions). What this ends up meaning, is that some gadgets are essentially redundant. Their functions overlap, with some being objectively better than others in similar functions. This... is weird, but seems a natural progression for the compartmentalized nature of the levels, I guess. Since each item is isolated, their functional overlap isn't really a problem.This plays a large part in what we're used to with Stealth games, then? Where you're presented a fairly solid challenge, but then can combine a wide array of tools to overcome it. This to say you expect very different tools and ways to combine them.The main think I dislike is how linear it is. It's just a set of small challenges. There are no optional objectives (like not getting seen, getting extra data, incriminating someone, etc. etc.), the point is really just following the planned path of each level and moving on to the next one. It made the game incredibly boring, to me.That said, I think this may appeal to people who are very into stealth games. Assuming you like the game loop a lot, you'll probably want to constrain yourself to never getting seen, completing the levels faster, etc. This is all fine, and I hope this is the real point of the game?Because otherwise, if you're expecting to be surprised, there isn't much here. The levels are too short, and the enemies too transparent, which creates some silly moments.Some people called this a puzzle game, more so than a stealth game. But then, you'd expect that most levels required a certain element of \"outside the box\" thinking, using the gadgets in unpredictable ways to overcome a particular challenge. And then building on it, etc. etc. But that isn't really the case. The game seems to guide you for the whole set of 100 levels. There might be some slight deviations for each player, but the levels' paths are mostly telegraphed, and don't really require much experimentation and \"aha!\" moments.Anyway.I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the right mindset to enjoy this game. If there's anything to take from here (in my perspective) is the artstyle. That was pretty amazing. Both when levels start and when enemies attack you, the way it affects the geometry looks really great! And, in general, I liked the way the game looked.  ",

Seriously.I don't even mean it as a negative against the game - that's what the game set out to do, it's about the programming *itself*.It does not present any of the possibilities of programming, where you could actually do and find cool stuff. Instead, it gives you a very, very limiting set of rules where you have to go several miles around the problem to solve it, instead of tackling things directly.Some people like the \"challenging\" aspect of programming. If you're one of those, give this a shot! (This generalizes easily - if you're someone who likes the challenge for its own sake, and not using the challenge to get somewhere \"new\") I really don't find it too enjoyable.I'll give it a recommendation, though, since the problem is not on the game itself. The game conveys the message (the specific type of programming, not talking about the story) fairly accurately, and that's good enough, for me!",

        "text": "I can't say I've enjoyed playing the game very much. It was very frustrating, at times... But, it is very short (2 hours to beat all 77 levels, for me), and it has some unique touches, so I'll stick with a recommendation.I'll talk about some of the aspects I did and did not like.First off, the visuals. They're rather strange, not the clean look I'm used to in platformers. But the game gives all the information necessary regardless, so nothing wrong there.I think it looks very nice! Certainly unique, even though it is a bit crude.The backgrounds have an almost blured, handpainted style. Then you have a few more elements like plants or clouds on top of them. The cool thing (and one of the problems I'll talk about) is that they're animated. In a way you don't really see very often.Crude, but I appreciated it for what it was.The problem with it is death. Usually, this is a problem with the music, but not there, surprisingly! When you die, all the animations reset. This doesn't help at all in a hard platformer where you die a lot in short time spans. As I said, it's usually a problem with the music resetting, and have to listen to the first 2 seconds over and over... the effect applies perfectly with the visual animations, here. It breaks the pace and heightens frustration.Now, the music. It's not anything memorable at all, but something merely there to set the mood, I guess. Because of the light/dark world theme. The instruments change in each one, with each cool, though not unexpected, I guess.Nothing impressive, but again, it's a welcome touch. It seems randomly generated, almost akin to drone music than actual music. A matter of personal preference here, I guess.Ok, now the problem with the level design, and the biggest source of frustration.In some respect, I liked the level design. It generally started with a simple pattern, and repeated it with added complexity (and difficulty) for a couple of levels, and sometimes recurring in later levels. This was alright. A few different mechanics to keep things fresh, all good! (not amazing, but still good enough, I thought)The problem is how precise the game requires you to be. The margin for error is really, really small, even in the first 10 levels, or so. This is a problem, because you've figured out what to do to beat the level, but then have to try many times to get the timing right. That's the main challenge of the game, your timing.You have to time not only the world switching mechanic, but also jumping over vines to a rather excessive precision.The make matters worse, the game has several sections where you have to repeat the same jump several times (4-10x). This was infuriating for me, when I knew what and how to do, but because of the ridiculous precision requires, I failed in one of the jumps somewhere and had to restart the level. It was needlessly difficult. By simply making vines smaller (even if slightly), I think it would have made the game much more enjoyable, focusing on level design rather than repetition over details. If anything, it's a lesson for the future - how much of an influence precision has in a platformer. The window seems too narrow, in this game.The other big problem, for me, was how the switching mechanic obscures half of the level. So, you almost have to die to look at the whole level, several times. On top of that, memorization becomes very important. You need to keep the hidden half in mind when traversing the first half, etc.At times, it was a welcome challenge! At others, it was dumb. Why? Because the game has very quick sections later on, and it's almost impossible to \"plan\". For me, it was a case of repeating over and over and over... until I had the timing right. I barely needed to look at the level, since I got the hang of an abstract timing for button presses.Oh well.So yeah, not a very good game. But it seems to be genuine in its presentation, both in the visuals and the music, so I think there's still some value here, despite the frustration in the gameplay.It's not a hearty recommendation, but you can get something out of it, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.P.S.: There are people saying the controls are broken, and the character doesn't always jump when press the button. This is true, but it only happens in a very specific circumstance: when you're at the edge of a platforming. Like, really, really, at the edge. When you are, you don't really fall, but the character doesn't jump. Not sure if it's a hitbox bug or what, but take that in mind. It didn't affect me too much.Although... with the precision the game aims for (and requires of you!), it does seem a bit of a blunder.",

        "text": "I really don't understand all the praise this game got over the years.I really enjoy metroidvanias, and this is generally regarded as one of the top! So I was excited to try it.Unfortunately, it just seems to streamline almost everything about the genre, and then cover it in the most gray, modern-military aesthetic they could think of, making it like most other modern \"standard\" games. I find that really boring?For example, the upgrades are some of the least inspired you can imagine: the world simply hides various grenade storage upgrades, as well as some HP/armor upgrades. The only somewhat cool secret is some passkey, I guess?The weapons are pure upgrades... So much so that they replace the old one. The exception is the grenade types, which are what you would expect as a Metroid \"gate\" weapon. These are also very standard and uninspired, though.The map design was very linear, keeping you moving forward for maybe 75% of the game. Up to this point, everything was the most standard thing you could imagine in a 2D modern shooter. I was very disappointed.For the last 15%, for some reason, the game decides that there are some much more powerful and somewhat more interesting upgrades that you should collect before ending the game. In this part, and only here, does the map design seem to fit a metroidvania -- mostly because it's the only part where you have to backtrack meaningfully. Some of the powerups here are actually pretty cool! But it's the last stretch of game, going through previously seen areas, only with newly found \"gate\" weapons so you can collect the inaccessible secrets.The last boss is nothing worth speaking about here.In conclusion, there was something remotely nice at the end. But that was it. For the most part, this game adds nothing to the genre. I don't understand why people talk about this as one of the best metroidvanias, honestly. It's not a bad game, I guess, but I'm pretty sure it will simply be out of my mind very quickly, since it didn't do anything remotely surprising or very well... P.S.: I went back to collect some of the stuff I missed. Spoilers ahead: The gold bars just gave you a golden suit, no added benefit; the pass key gave you the last power-up: invincibility when idle; Note that these apply only for the last section of the game, namely, the final boss. The final boss was incredibly easy without these, so it didn't change anything.Also, to give a feeling for what the writers thought would be a cool power fantasy: you defeat the last boss with 3 nuclear bombs. These explode closer to you than 1km. 3 behaving as pretty weak bombs, with absolutely no impact except in the ship they hit...Not a theme for me at all, I guess....",

        "text": "I'd like to give this one a thumbs up, but unfortunately, while it does a couple of things really well, it ends up not doing enough, and padding the experience far too much with down time.It also has some very strange choices that, while could have worked very well in a different game, didn't really fit with the overall game's purpose of playing a blind girl.I'll start with the good stuff. The game looks really nice! Not really a \"high fidelity\" game, but the watercolor texture looks unique, and plus, the way the world is revealed around the character is quite impressive! It reenforces that watercolor look a lot, since the colors spread around in a different shade, initially. Almost like when you spill water over ink-written paper. I really liked that!The game's use of color was also very cool! To convey fear, they simply added a darker/purple-y shade around the view. Very simple trick, but it somehow made the world feel very dark when that happened. Definitely a nice touch!The music may be contentious for some, mostly because of how sparse it is. But I enjoyed it, in the context of being a blind girl! It conveyed the isolation (I suppose) of someone who can't see, making the ambient sounds play a much larger role. Unfortunately, the sound wasn't really as big a part of the game as I would have imagined. A couple of piano melodies here and there, or more sombre drone sounds, but the music wasn't ever used to induce \"wonder\". They were going for something else, I guess.Now, onto the dubious stuff.The would is revealed around you as you walk. And it stays revealed forever. This is very strange, to me. Ignoring the blindness, it would be great! As I've mentioned the color spread effect. But... you're blind. Both the colorful world and its permanence seems at odds with the concept. Furthermore, they use a rain mechanic that erases your memory of the world, at some points. This makes it even weirder. It simply does not go together.Sometimes, when you \"trigger\" something, the world changes without you noticing, and that's fine. But, when you add the rain mechanic, the permanence of the world stops making any sense at all, to me.Aside from this, there are some nice touches. Especially by mis-recognizing sounds as something, until you get closer, and realize it was not what you thought. That was a nice touch as well! But, taking the previous things into account... Finally, and this is probably the worst thing about the game.The character walks really, really, really slowly. During the whole game. In a way, I understand. You're blind, thus insecure about the world around you. BUT. The world is revealed around you. Why not walk at least a bit faster when you know what's around you? It's another conflict between the game's art/visual style and the experience it was somehow trying to convey...To make things worst, the game seems padded with maze-like areas. Not really intricate mazes, but blocking paths to make you go around with barely anything worthwhile in between. It makes the game drag for so long... I just zoned out while walking several times, because there was nothing there to see.It seems to be there to meet the \"2-3 hour requirement\"... it's very frustrating.Finally, one point I forgot to mention:The game uses fear (from sound, especially) in a nice way, although sometimes too forced. One thing it did not do, however, is use danger.This felt an important point left out, to me. For example, there are bridges and small rivers in the game, with fairly steep paths. The problem is that there are invisible walls to block you from falling. This is bad, isn't it? If you're blind, there's an added risk of accidents happening in these areas.One could argue that the game was trying to be more peaceful and relaxing, perhaps... but then it uses fear as a blocking mechanic... There are a few things at odds, in this game. Several good ideas that conflict with each other, making the overall game much worse than it could have been.That's why I'm not recommending it, really. Plus, the padding made the game very dull to play through. Halfway through, you've probably seen most of what the game has to show, and at that point you start noticing how the game is trying to slow you down.I think I've mentioned everything. Hopefully, their next game can improve where this one failed, because there definitely are some nice ideas here!",

        "text": "This is a really nice game!Not groundbreaking, but it manages to convey childlike wonder with its story and mechanics that I don't see too often.It's a first person platformer, with a great sense of scale that, fortunately, works more in its favour than its detriment.There were some sections where it was hard to judge distances, due to the huge scale, but it wasn't a problem, most of the time. And when it was, it didn't get too frustrating.As the title suggesting, the game is about a story about the narrator's uncle, to his daughter.It's a rather simple minded adventure through a mystical world with frog people and a grappling hook that almost makes you fly.There are some darker overtones spread around the game for those interested (it requires attention to the environmental objects and also simple decryption), but the main game really did feel like an adventure.A big help is the amount of freedom that the game gives you in your movement. It's not too challenging, most of the time, but it allows for some additional difficulty if you want to find the secrets.One game I hadn't though about in a while is Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. This game reminded me of it, for great reasons! As I mentioned before, these two are the 2 of the few games I remember giving me this childlike wonder, making me want to explore all of these caves or suspicious paths. It's great!It also looks really good, and while short, the few sections it has you go through look very unique!One gripe I have with the game is the achievements. They're all very \"completionist\" oriented, which I don't really think fits in a game like this. They should have guided the player to look for the small details, instead of focusing on the \"100%\", which, in my opinion, puts players in a more systematic search for the required items, instead of actually exploring, if that makes sense? The objects stop being objects and start being an abstraction to get \"achievement points\", and you stop paying attention to how they fit into the overall experience.If you don't mind short games, definitely give this one a shot! Won't change your world, but I truly enjoyed playing it.Just strolling through the game and seeing the world they created is worth doing. ",

        "text": "(More details on scoring and leaderboard at the end)This is bloody brilliant.It's one of the few games that I can see most people enjoying based on the gameplay alone, yet still manages to introduce something very alien and unique through its art (both in its audio and visuals).The shortest description I can give is that it's something out of 2001: Space Odyssey? The weird part. The really, really crazy part.And it's beautiful.The game can get tough, but it never seemed unfair, to me. I really enjoyed the challenge and now I'm planning to go through it all over again several time to master it... why? Because the flow of the game is amazing. It's a rollercoaster, in many ways... But it's hard to judge it when you have to restart some levels repeatedly. I'm curious about how it would feel to go through it in one single run. ... It might take a while, though.The music is very interesting, and probably not something for your mp3. Brian Gibson has a \"noise rock\" band, which is... noisy? The game itself is what I would call \"noise classical\", perhaps? Know the discordant violins in horror movies? That's a big of part of this.The other part is the industrial/metallic tribal percussion.It's strange, but it's perfect for the game.The visuals are also very abstract and metallic, but very beautiful, in parts. Something harmonious, sometimes discordant as well. And always very alien.The \"feel\" of the game is some of the best I've seen in any game... ever?It's that good. If you string combos together, your hits become very powerful, complementing the strange rhythm of the music with the rhythm of the level, which are not always \"cooperative\".I can't say much more about it, for now. But it's amazing!If you're looking for a rhythm game in the vein of Guitar Hero or Stepmania, this is not at all for you. It's not about playing your own music... This game is its own beast. If you're not into its aesthetic (which I can imagine many people are not?), you will probably not enjoy the game very much... some people consider it all to blend together. I disagree, but I can see that happening, depending on what you're expecting. So yeah. If the videos seem cool, definitely get it. There's a lot more to the game than shown in the videos due to the visceral feeling and impact of the game.So good!P.S.: I've now beaten the game twice, to see how much it would change. On general terms, there's definitely replayability without wanting to climb the leaderboards. This is because you can still play the previous levels in a very different way by using the new mechanics that you didn't know when you first did the levels.This can make some levels far, far, harder. But also much more satisfying! It's really cool to see how levels were designed in different ways depending on how much of the game you've played before.The scoring system is also more complex than it first seemed.There's a basic C-B-A-S \"rank\" for each sub-level, and then calculated for the full level. These mostly depend on your misses. S being for missing no \"Thump\".You can't replay specific levels, at the moment, but you can restart the sub-level that you're playing. This means that you have to play the whole level from start to finish to get these rankings, but you can restart each one as much as you'd like before moving on.The scoring, which will get you on the leaderboards, is where the real game is.For these, restarting carries a penalty. So, to reach the top, you need to play every sub-level in a row, as well as you can, without restarting to get the optimal score for each one. It's a marathon, more so than a sprint.I can see this being a somewhat controversial system, but I like it. It's the hardcore way to play the game, and I'm glad that there is one, rather than seeing how restarts the most.For the score, you have to study the levels, somewhat, because of the \"stomp\" mechanic. On 2 consecutives Thumps, you can use the first to fly, and stomp the second for extra points. This is even more important in boss fights, where you're awarded multipliers for stomping the final thump (sorry for this vocabulary haha).Aside from that, there are the riskier plays of trying to make a perfect curve, etc. (to get a perfect, you have a much narrower window to turn -- otherwise, you're dead).It makes it much more interesting, choosing when to play aggressively or not, trying to get a good score. There's quite a bit of depth for those looking to climb leaderboards, so that's definitely another plus!P.S.2: Consistency is way more important than I realized before. Each consecutive level you beat without a Miss gives up a 1+ multiplier. The same for No Damage levels. So your score really gets out of control if you can avoid missing/damage for many consecutive levels. It's good to keep the competition high!One kinda big problem I have, though, has to do with the \"game feel\". I really like the whole impact the game conveys, but I think it takes a step too far by slowing down the game too much for give a very high impact in a long combo. This slow down actually throws me off completely, sometimes, because the rhythm breaks in these situations. So... you're expecting a certain obstacle at a certain time, but the tempo slows down a lot and then speeds up again. It leads to a rather inconsistent rhythm when you're actually doing great!Which is a negative. Sure, it makes it harder to do perfect runs, but it essentially punishes good play? I would much rather have a lower impact in these long combos, but be able to keep the \"flow\", so to speak.",

        "text": "This is a positive review, but I wouldn't really recommend this one. I mean, it's okay, but it's very similar to Hexcells in terms of the thinking involved, but also not as good? That's arguably, because of the way some of the puzzles here are solved, but I'll write about it in a bit.If you've played Hexcells, you know more or less what you're getting. What I was expecting, though, was a bit of variety in the pictures formed (probably because of Picross). It would be a nice addition and departure from Hexcells, having a more visual component to the puzzles. The game isn't really designed as so, which is very clear when you finish a level, by getting a dark gray screen over the picture, making it much less of a focus.This was just my own expectation, though, having very little to do with the game.Why don't I think this is as good as Hexcells?Well, Hexcells always relied on a single move (although there were several possible, at times) that you discovered after a bit of thinking. Mostly by having many constraints and finding just the right combination to put them together and find a new move. Then you could have a few quick moves in succession because of the new insight, until you get stumped again and are in need to a new \"aha!\" moment.This is mostly because every move in Hexcells is a commitment, of sorts. Whether you \"reveal\" or \"hide\" a piece, you're making a final decision. If it's wrong, the game complains and you are penalized on the final score. This is good!SquareCells has some of that, but toned down. Only \"hide\" moves are a final commitment. \"Reveal\"s are not. This seems a very small change, but it seemed to influence the puzzles as well: instead of being able to rely on the \"aha!\" moment every time, you sometimes had to try a couple of paths. You would \"Reveal\" certain pieces, and execute the successive new moves hoping to find a contradiction in the rules -- if you did, you simply undo those moves and try another option.This is a small change in the puzzles' logic, but it seemed to be very important, to me. And I didn't enjoy this kind of longer trains of thought.I guess the \"aha!\" moments are simply trains of thought of the same kind, but shorter trains. As a result, you can do them quickly in your head, almost unconsciously, and get a kick from it.When you have to explicitly try out different paths, it gets messy.I hope this didn't get too pseudo-scientific... Perhaps other people will have a greater capacity for this kind of logical thought and find HexCells and SquareCells exactly the same? Either way, SquareCells is still a very solid game! And if you need another dose of HexCells, this is an alternative.",

        "text": "INK is a surprisingly good platformer!Despite having some fairly difficult levels, it's not comparable to, say, Super Meat Boy. In some ways, this is a good thing! If you're looking to scratch some of SMB's itch without dedicating dozens of hours to mastering a game, this is a good option!It took me less than 2 hours to finish all 75 levels, and around 3.5 hours to beat it again, this time collecting every coin (20), which was both harder and more time consuming, as you had to both play riskier to grab the coin, and spend more time exploring the levels, looking for it.You probably know that the main mechanic is that you have to \"paint\" the levels to see the platforms. Even this is evocative of Super Meat Boy, in which I sometimes wasted time painting levels... with blood.This seems an obvious mechanic in hindsight, but it's surprising how well it works!In INK, you can double jump and wall jump. Touching a wall replenishes your double jump. The levels have you go through platforming, and sometimes having to jump on enemies (killing all of them) or collecting keys to unlock the end level's door. The levels should take much longer than a few seconds (most of the time).When you die, you explode in colors splashes, coloring nearby walls. When you double jump, a similar explosion happens. Touching tiles will also color them. This is basically the game (with a few more obstacles later on).The color mechanic gives depth to the game in several ways. The most common is just how you'll generally play for the first time, sacrificing yourself to gain information. That's cool, but not very interesting.It gets more interesting when you throw in speedrunning and flawless runs!Flawless runs (no-death runs), although I can only imagine them being infuriating, should be very cool, because you'll also to play very carefully, trying to reveal the platforms without sacrifice. Speedrunning is similar, because a sacrifice costs time. It may help you on the long run, however, if you choose the best places to die.It also helps that the game is pretty short for speedrunning, or even multiplayer races should be fun (although I don't think there is built-in multiplayer).I don't have much to say about level design. There are 3 patterned bosses, but they're not too difficult.Level do get harder, introducing new hazard every few levels.The first set of 25 levels has only holes and basic enemies; the second introduces spikes; the third introduce heat seeking missiles (that are a huge pain!). There are also collapsing platforms and keys, but what I mentioned above seemed the defining obstacles, in my experience.Some of the levels follow a similar template, but get progressively harder, by introducing some spikes, or cannons.The controls felt pretty good to much. It's a faster game than SMB, but not as tight, in places. What threw me off somewhat, was wall-jumping, because you jump off with quite a lot of speed. Other than that, I felt that the controls were really good. After getting used to them, some platforming feats were very satisfying!One complaint that I have, regarding the no-death achievements, is that they're not very well supported by the game's interface. They have you beat each \"world\" (25 levels) without dying. If you die, though, you'll have to manually quit to the menu, and select the first level again. It's annoying because levels are placed linearly, so you'll have to go through 1-2-3-4-5-6...75 every time you have to switch for a distant level. Maybe a simple system to restart at 1-26-51 would have been better for these achievements.I meant, in this game especially, I feel that the achievement reveal a different aspect of the mechanics, instead of being \"just another challenge\", since the paint mechanic does provide interesting choices or paths. As such, better support would be welcome.It's a fairly minor complaint, though. I had a lot of fun in the game, and I may play some more, going for speedrunning, or flawless runs. Recommended!",

It's a blast!So yeah, this being the second game from Iridium Studios, I wanted to try it.It wasn't quite was I expected in many ways, and I was disappointed, overall. Regardless of its faults, though, it did try to do something new, making the whole game playable with Voice Commands. It's the first time I've seen it done and, although it was rough around the edges, it was fully functional! And in some ways it certainly enhanced the experience!The story seemed interesting, at first, but I found it very convoluted as the game went on, trying to fit every trendy Computer Science subject into its story, without any time to flesh it out. It turned out to pull a trick every 30 minutes, 15 of which were spent in battle. It started as a Cryptography/Privacy problem (Snowden), went through  superintelligence, brain emulation/uploading, brain and memory reconstruction from data (cloning), we're all living in a simulated universe,... In a game that was less than 4 hours (the credits were like 30 minutes), there are far too many ringing words pulled out of nowhere, because they sounded cool. Not my cup of tea. And I like sci-fi! But... not when every concept is thrown into a very tight space. Anyway...The good part about the narrative, though, is how the voice-commands fit in. The whole game is voice-acted, and you give orders to the characters in the game, who sometimes reply (although in a generic way), and make you part of the story, at times.It was mostly surprising how the voice acting seemed to make the narrative much more engaging, to me, because of the my own voice commands. It all fit in, and I think it was the best use of the voice-recognition feature in the game. Because you were being talked to, and talking back, it all felt more real, in a sense. I'd like to see more of this direction in other games!Gameplay-wise, it's nothing special. If not for the voice commands, it would be quite the contrary. You simply move units from A to B (each spot is given a name like AlphaX, with X being a number). You ask character NAME to move to A, and focus on EnemyX. You can also switch weapons, but that's about it.The voice commands have a certain latency associated with them, taking about 1 seconds to be recognized. And some of them are missed, although surprisingly few, to me (a foreign speaker). Because of this, the game couldn't really rely on precise commands and too tactical gameplay. Even though there are subtleties to the mechanics, they most pass unnoticed, because the technology isn't perfect, yet.There's also very little gameplay in the game. It's mostly cutscenes, with a bit of combat between them.All in all, I don't think it's very good. But it's also innovative, and there were some uniquely positive aspects in the game as a result! So it will get a recommendation, but mostly for people who are curious about how the voice commands play out.As I said, I think they really enhance the narrative, making game story-telling more promising than we're used to.The story was very messy, to me, and the gameplay was very light.If you're okay with it, give it a shot. Either way, I'm looking forward to what Iridium Studios come up next!P.S.: specific point about the story, full of spoilers The game shows a \"God\" intelligence that is far too human, to be honest... if it's from another universe, far more resourceful, should it be very alien? And have vastly different motivations? I just don't like the way it aims at grandeur, but ends up falling very short, with the so called \"Anthropomorphism\", which is a nice sounding word for, in this case, \"aliens/other intelligences are probably weird and not very human\".

        "text": "A big improvement over the previous game, Shin Samurai Jazz, in basically every respect, but the game itself (level design, specifically).What stroke me first was how good the game felt to play! The controls are very tight, and both the movement and combat feel very nice! The animation go much better with the moves, and the combat is much clearer in regards to your range and how enemies are affected by the attacks.The second thing that stroke me, on the negative side, was how the game had 20-30 rooms of meaningless combat/platforming until anything even remotely like an objective was given to the player. And even then, it was very vague. It was filler, like the previous one. And the worst was to come later...It appears that Blaze Epic likes making the same game over and over again. Usually, that's a bad thing. In this case, things are improving, so it could be worse! You have the same moveset: double jump, dash, attack. These moves serve both for combat and platforming, which is nice.The biggest problem with the platforming (aside from how much of it is filler) is that there are spikes in every \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 wall. But the infuriating thing are some chandeliers that throw fire at you. In the middle of the platforming sections, of course. And they're indestructible. And the worst thing about them is their random firing time. It makes it impossible to predict when they're going to shoot, so you're just have to pray that they shoot at a convenient time, in the middle to this very precise platforming you have to do...Later on there's also 1-hit kill lava (for barely touching it, too), which wasn't satisfying at all - the reason being that you have spikes above you, lava below, and a very, very tiny margin for error. Some rooms get frustrating, but it could have been worse.The game is more or less (mostly less) a metroidvania, in the sense that you have a full map to explore as you feel like. It's a very bad metroivania, though. You have all the abilities from the start. Which makes the exploration rather redundant, doesn't it? Well, too bad. The map is fairly large, and it's all absolute filler.There isn't a story to speak of. It tries to give you hints of a story, but there is none, since the end  is simply a tension and not-release deal, because the character dies before revealing the big secret . This could be interesting, but not in this case. It was just a poor excuse for not having a story.I mentioned about Shin Samurai Jazz that the level design was just about getting keys to unlock doors to unlock other doors, right? Well, it's exactly the same here, if not worse. Worse, because sometimes you have to go to the extremes of each area to open the door you wanted from the beginning, going back and forth, accomplishing absolutely nothing. Same rooms, same enemies, same abilties, etc. etc. Each area seems different, but it's purely its coating, because every enemy and platforming ends up virtually the same.The only design to speak of are the Bosses, but even them have a single pattern, and not a very interesting one in any of the cases.It's almost disrespectful to design levels like this, as silly as this sounds. It's literally about making you go back and forth to unlock doors, filling your time until it's worth any money (because people really like talking about time/money in videogames....).Even though the controls are pretty good, the game ends up being worthless, because it has no purpose, and so makes the player wander aimlessly back and forth, collecting keys and destroying crystals for no reason...Because there was some improvement, I'm still hopefull about Blaze Epic's games (Nil Ninjahtic actually looks really good), but it will decline soon, if every game is the same, with the grand purpose of unlocking door and lead into other doors, that lead...",

        "text": "Better than Samurai Jazz, for sure, but still not worth the time. It's easier, in some ways, and certainly less frustrating (with the exception of the end, which had no saves, so I decided I didn't want to play this anymore...).The level design is 90% filler, and there is one obstacle that, while cool, the game uses over and over and over again (which is to use dash to pass under and obstacle, followed by a double jump into a higher wall). Aside from this, which is a good use of the game's mechanics (though overused to death), the rest is just a way of prolonging the game long enough to be worth money (?)... I mean, the whole game consists of going into several buildings to key a key to the next, to get a key to the next, to get a key to the next, to finally get into the building you wanted to in the first place.There a part in a mall where there are like 10 different door that you need to try out whenever you get a new key. It's absolutely pointless. Especially, as I mentioned, when the game has one good trick that it simply uses everywhere.The enemies are varied enough, but quickly get redundant when you find the strategy. The combat isn't bad, but it's too outdated to keep up. It's mostly about keeping your distance, and timing attacks to keep enemies stunned.I also don't really understand why the music gets so much praise. It certainly has a very definity style, but it's mostly elevator music. And it doesn't really play along with the game. It's just background elevator music...Not much else to say. The platforming isn't bad, in places, but it could use far more variety. And you start with every ability from the start, so the game can't really build different sections for when you have only x or y ability, and them build up from there.I realize that my impressions are very negative, but I just don't see the point in playing this game. The story is simply an excuse to get you from place to place, doing the same things over and over again. But at least it's an improvement over the last one. Maybe his later games are good.",

        "text": "I haven't really digged deep into this game, but I think I can give a few useful directions to whoever is looking into it:As a game, Audiosurf is better. Much better. However, its match three mechanics are also a big distraction from the music (to me, anyway), and you mostly go with the rhythm. Riff Racer seems to be at its best when you're using it as a virtual habitat to your music. The biggest problem is that it somewhat limits the kind of music it goes well with. The level do follow the music (contrary to what most people seem to be saying), but not in a beat per beat basis, on my experience. They mostly follow the flow of the music. If you listen to 3minute songs, exclusively, with the standard verse-chorus progression, you won't have as much fun. With longer songs, however, with multiple parts, some faster, some slower, etc., the game creates various different sections of the levels that can be really fun! Most striking is the amount of drifting and ramps you'll find.I prefer this to Audiosurf (at least so far), because the drifting is quite a lot of fun! Audiosurf is simply going left/right. Since I'm not interested in the score maximizing match three in it, I stuck with the monochrome mode, which isn't all that fun. With Riff Racer, controlling the drifting and dodging obstacles is a blast, at times! Now, about its limitation: the game is full of neon, bright colors, futuristic city with looping tracks. I don't really think it fits the blues, or classical music. You may disagree, but that this is mind.Where it shines, though, is with some electronic (retrowave, specifically, as I don't really listen to or know a lot of electronic music artists) music. Perturbator and Dynatron are gateway artists to it. And with this type of music, the game is really, really fun! The driving isn't too distracting, so you can both enjoy the music and have an environment that fits.Honestly, I'd like to see something like this, but with many more different environments, tailored for the different music genres. Maybe I'll try Driving Truck Simulator for some blues/hard rock. This isn't really a review, but a rather confused collection of thoughts. Regardless, hope it's useful!",

        "text": "Not the best game I've played, but the story certainly seems more interesting than most games manage. On the lower side, however, there is very, very little story here... The game is just the first episode, and about 70% is game filler (you know, run around looking for whatever item you missed, solve several puzzles that don't really add to the story, etc. etc.).My first impressions were mostly bad, but it got better. The main problems, initially, is how the animations don't really flow into one another, giving a game a very amateur feel. The interface and controls are also pretty bad. Even the standard mouse pointing is off the mark. You have to hold right mouse button to aim, instead of aiming at all times, as is usual. The other problem is the basic interaction: you have to hold Shift for a menu to appear with several option that you have to navigate to with WASD. I don't understand why this is the case. There are so many buttons, even on a controller... oh well.Other than that, the game has some nice moments. I like the way it looks, in terms of atmosphere and aesthetic, but the graphics to look crude. The darkness hides it somewhat, so it gets the point across. The music what ok, nothing that stood out to me, either positively or negatively.It's not a point n' click game (literally), but it's structured like one, with very similar puzzles. You're not ever trying to solve a problem with a set of tools you can explore - instead, you're mostly looking for the only solution that may or may not make sense. The game sometimes seems to take options away from you, forcing you to take a longer route to the solution for no reason... as I said, it's mostly filler, unfortunately.The story, however, had some interesting things! You're an AI in a strange facility and you learn about as the game goes on. Your job is to protect your pilot, guided by 3 golden rules (like Asimov's, but with a more specific purpose).The biggest fault is really how little there is to go on. I can't really say much about it, about the things I liked and disliked, because it seems only the first little bit of the story. I wouldn't recommend it for the base price. I got it for 1$ on sale, and it was worth that much. But I'd advise anyone to wait for the second episode, since this one doesn't even come close to a conclusion, or get a point across.",

        "text": "Very nice casual platformer! It's more old-school, collect-a-ton, like Super Mario, rather than the more modern precision platformers like Super Meat Boy. So, even if you don't really like how tough most platformers are, this one you can certainly enjoy.I've never played Katamari Damacy, but the idea is clearly similar. More recently, perhaps Agar.io. Also, Gish!The physics were absolutely nailed, as the character you control really feels like a blob. Very fun to just play around, trying to collect everything.The level variety is fairly high, with different sections, some timed, some more puzzle oriented (although there is very light puzzling only), etc. The levels are replete with references to other games through alien-related puns.The graphic style reminds me a lot of old cartoons, and the music fits the silly, old sci-fi vibe very well too.If you're into leaderboard climbing, each level counts pretty much everything you do, from collectibles to time spent to count your score, so that may be up your alley. I'm not sure how much better the levels would seem with a 100% speedrun mindset, but many of the orbs' arrangements do seem to have an optimal path. So yeah, if mastering physics is your thing, I'd doubly recommend this!A very fun diversion, if nothing else! If you enjoy more casual platformers, give it a go. It's fairly short, though, as I've finished (with about 90-95% of the collectibles and medals, etc.?) in 3.7 hours.",

It's almost a droning sound, very low (bass-y), but it's really uncomfortable. And, when you die (which is a lot), it slightly stops and goes back to the beginning. I've never had a game do that to me, but it's really bad! Surprisingly so.Anyway, iffy hitboxes, the first campaign level is not only too hard, but also a disjointed mess.

        "text": "Cool little experiment of a game!Missing Translation has 2 aspects to it, essentially: First,  puzzles. 75 puzzles, 25 of each type. The first set is pure graph theory. Essentially, you need to choose a path to clear all the dots without crossing the same one twice.The second set is about trying to fit various pieces into place, but as you move one, the other moves as well. So you're trying to lock them in place until you can move all 2-3 into their proper places.The third set is like rotating domino. Each piece has 4 sides that can be 1 of 2 colors. You rotate pieces until each side is paired with a side of the same color.As far as a puzzle game goes, this isn't too good. It's not awful either, but the puzzles are, for the most part, too easy. The first set was nice and some of the later puzzles weren't immediately solved (took 30 seconds to a minute, maybe? so they're still pretty easy, but not brainless). The third set, however, was very, very easy. Mostly because each puzzle had tons of solutions, so you just had to align the pieces that were out of place and everything pretty much worked without much thought. Overall, these puzzles seem to be mostly filler. They didn't seem to serve a purpose of guide you into more and more difficult puzzles.The other part, is trying to solve the language of the game. It's a bit too much like Fez, unfortunately, so it didn't seem as impactful and it may have otherwise been?There's a very simple numbering system, and another emoticon system. Though the symbols themselves don't have an obvious meaning, you'll find a room in the game that will clear the meaning for you, if you pay attention to the clues throughout the game.The numbering system was... okay. One part made sense; spoilers: the number was given by the number of lines in the symbol; HOWEVER, how they're connected made no sense at all, and it require back and forth to figure out. The puzzle that was solved by the numbers was also too obscure. It was easy for me because the particular sequence shown was very common in some of my classes-- but for someone in any other area, it can't make any sense. It came out of nowhere, really, with no relation whatsoever with the game.The emoticon system was pretty cool, if a little strange to figure out. And, once again, was mostly meaningless. It was never used in the game itself. Just a very very tiny bit of backstory or flavour, I guess. Which is okay, since it's a free game.Two last things: though the graphics were mostly \"meh\", I really liked the intricated patterns on the puzzle tiles and some other parts of the game. They look cool.The music was also fairly enjoyable, though nothing to write home about.This game does try to do some things a little differently, and it gets a mild recommendation for that. But its ideas are a bit too purposeless and sparse for it to be something special.",

        "text": "Crazy Plant Shop is a pretty cool game while you're still figuring out the mechanics. Mixing plants and understanding how the dominant and recessive traits work in your favour (or against you). After you do understand, however, the game gets very monotonous. Every mission is just someone asking you x number of plants with x and y traits. So you mix your plants to get the desired result. And that's about it. Some light management aspects to it, knowing when to buy a plant or mix them, etc., but those aspects don't make much of a difference, overall.It also gets very dull to have to repeat the same procedure over and over and over again. Click here, click there, wait for the menu to pop-up, click here, open menu, close menu, etc. etc.It would definitely benefit from a pipeline mechanic, like in SpaceChem, so that you could automatize everything. But that would be a different game altogether, I guess.I'm not too keen on the educational aspect of the game. I mean, it's still sistematic/mechanic learning. You're not exploring, digging, investigating anything through trial and testing, for the most part. Which would be the real joy of learning? Like this, it's following a textbook in videogame form. You're still just going through the required motions without ever being surprised. They don't give you a fairly obscure objective that requires you to explore the mechanics until you figure out a possible path to the solution. Instead, you're just kind of memorizing what you need to do, and then you're done. Which is unfortunate, but not unexpected...Not my kind of \"educational\" game, but it may help with middle/high school tests, I guess.",

        "text": "Anoxemia is the lowest \"positive\" I can probably give. In a way, I really liked that the game used unconventional mechanics which went hand in hand with the atmosphere really well, and loosely reenforced the story. On the other hand, this was one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.There are 38 levels, most of them taking 2 minutes or so. Longer levels may take 5 minutes. But even so, I had to do only a couple of levels at a time to avoid smashing my computer.This frustration is not because the game is hard, but because the game has very poor controls and quite a lot of bugs. And, of course, levels have no checkpoint, so you restart each time.The game is one giant escort mission, and everyone knows how much those are loved in other games... right? ... There's the main problem, aside from the controls and bugs. Getting stuck in walls yourself (drone), your character not being able to go around corners, very high inertia, etc. etc.It's very unfortunate that the game had so many issues that were mostly outside the game itself. Of course, they could have designed around the issues, but the game itself could have been really nice!The slow pace and obscurity make for a very nice experience, especially when you have to scavenge the area very carefully for oxygen and batteries.The atmosphere, between the graphics and music was absolutely nailed, and it was a joy to be in it, when immersed. The story is something that I wasn't really invested in, mostly because of expectations. It's strangely similar to the movie Moon (2009) that I've seen a few weeks ago. I was expecting isolation and claustrophobia... but I get clones' rights propaganda. Maybe it was an excuse for the way the game is structured?A really unfortunate part of the game is how much of it is filler. And it's filled with frustration... There are many levels that serve very little purpose to the actually story/atmosphere, but you have to do them anyway to fill the required 4 or 5 hours of gameplay... because otherwise people will be mad that they could have gotten \"better value\" for their money...Argh, it was so close to being awesome!I think you're probably better off getting Capsule, since the mechanics are very similar, in places. This game is more modern, in a good way, though. And has more stuff going on in it. But... the frustration is too high for me to recommend. Most of the time, I didn't enjoy it. There was a time when I was encountering a new bug in every level. Also, spoilers now. The game's plot-twist is that you're a clone. And there are hints in the game to make you figure that out. Unfortunately, they're completely apart your actions. They're just little scripted scenes with dozens of dead bodies, and some of the dialogue lines (that are repeated a looooot). I didn't like that at all. The best way would probably be to actually keep your dead body in the level. As in, when you die, when you go back to that place, your body is there. That's a much more... personal? way of hinting the clone thing. I find that I barely notice these scripted things anymore. They're very superficial in a videogame, to me. I'd much rather play attention to how the game reacts to my actions than just enduring filler for 10 minutes until I reach story bit #5.Okay, rant over. I hadn't done one of those in a while.Not something I'd recommend under most circumstances. It has far too many flaws. But I like the game's intentions, and it does have some very nice aspects to it, so I'll very cautiously give it a \"positive\" mark, whatever that means.P.S.: This is very scummy, but it seems that the top review is by one of the developers... Of course, it's positive and says very nice things about the game... some of which aren't exactly true. Especially the \"hardcore\", \"fairness\" and \"Dark Souls\" bit. The game is mostly buggy and clunky. There are a few other Ukranian reviews that are a bit suspicious (the game being ukranian)... so be wary. Also, they usually have 11-13 hours in the game when the game is fairly short, if you manage to avoid the bugs. I lost way too much time and it was still under 7 hours, so take that in mind. I'll have more because, even after 7 hours, not cards dropped.",

        "text": "This has probably become one of my favourite Metroidvanias on Steam (along with Valdis Story)! Not something I'd hold as the hallmark of game design, but the combat is so good that it makes playing the whole game really fun, despite being somewhat monotonous, otherwise.Valdis Story is a very methodical metroivania with a pretty deep combat system (with combo-cancelling, lot's of timed dodges and parries, etc.) and tough, pattern based boss fights that you really need to try to learn and pay attention to learn the game, and it's incredibly satisfying when you do!Dust: An Elysian Tail, on the other hand, is very loose. You fight dozens of enemies at once, if necessary, but your attacks are very large and throw enemies all over the place, making you feel like a badass! Fighting these many enemies at once is really satisfying, if not a bit too chaotic to be challenging (in a fair way). The crux of it is that your sword attacks have a rather wide range, and you have the ability to suck enemies in. With that, plus a helpful magic, you'll easily manage dozens of enemies, racking up combos of 1000+, at times. In short, you're like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 tornado. With fire/lightning at the center.And that's enough, surprisingly enough. The combat is very fluid and looks awesome!Most of the game will be you tearing throw many enemies at once. However, there are different enemies, some of which can be tough, and require more attention, and parrying to defeat. Which helps a lot to keep things somewhat fresh!The most disappointing thing was the boss fights. They're mostly really easy. And I was playing on the highest difficulty. On the whole, the game is fairly easy, if you take your time to explore and learn how to deal with different enemies. Only one of the bosses was somewhat hard to me, requiring a few tries, making me switch my tactics a bit.The game had one frustrating element, which was the environmental hazards, in some places. These do a ton of damage, often killing you in 1 or 2 hits... But, otherwise, the game was very fair. With one exception (graveyard), checkpoints were very kindly placed, so you never lose much progress on death.The game as a lot of other features, like a crafting system, and fairly wide equipment system, leveling up, etc. etc. These all worked pretty well, giving you several options to tackle your progression, but they couldn't really be a focus for any player. They're there to support the combat and keep the progression up, nothing more.As a metroidvania, especially regarding the abilities you gain, it wasn't spectacular (well, the abilities weren't very interesting), but the exploration element is very present, and in a good way!The game has side-quests that cannot be completed when you first get them, making you go back to the places you've been to after you get more abilities and... have grown overpowered. Going back to previously hard areas and feeling like a God is ... well, it makes you feel like a God. (The leveling system is exponential which explains how much more powerful you get after each area)There are several references to other games, which are nice, and lots of treasure and blueprints to help you get stronger.The map system is also very generous, telling you the screens where you've missed something with an icon so you can easily check back later and know more or less what you may be missing.\u00b4I don't want to write much more about it. The game is beautifully drawn and has some nice screen effects (distortions, for the most part), with one of the most fun combat systems around. So definitely give it a go!Not the most challenging game, so try Valdis Story if you're looking for a more difficult game.",

Awful controls, and terribly gimmicky game making for very very slow replays, despite the levels being 40 seconds long.I really, really dislike this one, that doesn't happen too often. Every level I feel like dropping it because of the counter intuitive way to solve the levels with very poor hit detection, while keeping you boxed in a tiny area, killing you if you leave it even a bit... No.P.S.: The bonus level could have been a very nice thing. You have a completely different vehicle, which is kinda nice. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to test it and check that it has very, very imprecise hitboxes, in a level with very narrow paths. So yeah, you die several times without \"touching\" the bombs. ... This is game has the most contrived levels I've ever seen.",

        "text": "Very straightforward shoot 'em up that, unfortunately, doesn't do anything different or even better than any other game. Instead, it's very lacking in almost every respect...The only designed piece of this game is the Boss Fights, of which there are 3. They're not spectacular bosses, but at least there's something to them.Here's a rundown of the game:Ship Upgrades: 1 damage upgrade, 2x 1 front shot, 2x 1 lateral shot.Game Progression: Periodical spawning of enemies that simply fly downwards until you kill 100 of them, then a Boss fight. This happens 3 times. After each boss, the enemies get a stronger version spawning.That's about it. Yeah. There are occasional enemies that spawn form the sides or that shoot, but nothing game changing.There's a Hardmode, in which every enemy shoots, instead of the basic ones simply flying downwards.There isn't even a scoring system to the game! The only score \"mechanic\" is that each enemy killed increases it by one. Different enemy types (with different HP, or that shoot or w/e) increase the score by one as well. Not differentiation there.... There's also the fact the gamepad and keyboard controls are different. Keyboard has default Unity physics, while the Gamepad has a more \"digital\" movement (for lack of a better word... no physics, move directly left/right).There are powerups, but they're redundant after you get the ship upgrades. With the exception of \"lives\".Speaking of which... You have one shot. If you get hit, you'll have to restart. Unless you have additional lives that occasionally drop. That's ... annoying, but okay. The bigger problem is that there is absolutely no feedback when you're hit. And there's apparently a 3 lives limit, even after you collect more. It's just... so barebones. Doesn't do anything that I'd consider surprising or good. And doesn't compensate in being somewhat compelling in variety or good design. So yeah, I wouldn't recommend this one.",

        "text": "Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut is a pretty average metroid-vania. Has all the backtracking you should expect, but often feel very artificial, the way you have to go much further left/right to keep things moving forward for very little reason.The combat and the controls in general could be better, as I often missed attacks and platforms that seemed like a hit because of dodgy hitboxes... But other than that, it's okay.The progression is rather bland, in comparison with many other Metroidvanias - the abilities you gain are transformations into animals with different abilities. These, however, don't serve much purpose aside from clearing \"progress walls\". Without X transformation, you can't get past this wall, but other than that, the game plays the same throughout... which defeats the purpose, to me. Take Guacamelee, for example: each ability gave you both platforming and combat possibilities you didn't have before, with challenges to match it. By that end, you had a pretty wide array of abilities and combos that you learned as you played. None of that here. The combat is simply about keeping your distance and spamming attack.The exploration element is rather weak as well, only gaining \"jam\" that you can use to upgrade your magic abilities (which aren't very interesting either) or your attack speed.The graphics are pretty nicely done, though, and the music as well, although it's not my favourite of Jake Kaufman's soundtracks.There are also some sequence issues that can very easily throw you off, because characters are hinting at the next sequence, thinking you've completed an objective that you have not. This happened to me twice, which is not good at all. Especially since the game's map is rather awkward, and you have no ability whatsoever to mark places on the map.To make matters worse, it deleted all of my progress. It may be because I changed the controls (although I changed them when I first started playing, and only now, after restarting the computer, as the progress been deleted)... which is another can of worms: the game has confirm on B and back on A, for some reason. And doesn't let you rebind the keys properly, requiring you to alter a hex file, etc. etc. Yeah, not a very positive review, is it? Despite all of the issues, the game is okay. I mean, if you're looking for a simple metroidvania, it will do the job. But aside from that, there really isn't anything special here. It seems like a game made for the sake of the classics rather than its own thing, but hey, it works.",

        "text": "It's sad to see so many people not giving the game a chance. I'm 10 hours in and still only been able to beat 2 out of 4 missions -- and still have Endless Mode to try out.So this is not the review, yet. But, while the controls and the several ship abilities take quite a while to get used to, it's very rewarding when you do. If you're played Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages, you have some idea of what you can expect regarding the controls and abilities. GALAK-Z does not feature the huge amount of customization that RingRunner did, but it does offer a few choices. And the gameplay is tighter, in a sense - it's much harder, and you'll have to master each ability to be able to complete a chapter.You're weaker than most of your adversaries. But you have more tools, and you can use the environment as a trap. So you really can succeed.Again, the controls may put you off initially, but it's definitely worth sticking with. Here's a game that requires a bit more dedication than most, but for a good reason.Not perfect, but I'm enjoying it!",

        "text": "CAPSULE is a fairly unconventional game. Alien and hostile instead of fun. But worth every minute, despite being very short.You're inside a vessel of some kind (I assume a submarine, but the details aren't too important). You try to get from base to base, investigating what's happening around you and trying to reach home.As I said, it's not \"fun\". From the screenshots, you can see there's very little that the game gives you. You're isolated inside a capsule, and the radar is your only contact with the outside world. To get from base to base, you'll have to balance your oxygen and power levels. If you run out of oxygen, you die. If you run out of power... well, you'll then be stuck in place, slowly running out of oxygen... until you die. There's still hope, though, as you may be able to get the engine started!You'll have to use your active radar to check what the points on your map are. These may be enemy creatures, mines, fuel, air tanks, and others. The important thing to note is that using your active radar enables your enemies to detect the signal and know where you are. If you get too close to some of them, you'll also be detected.Each mission is essentially the same, trying to get from A to B without running out of oxygen. The difficulty increases, of course. And by the last few missions, you'll have to dive (heh) into the deeper mechanics to survive, as supplies are very rare.So far, although the mechanics are all very coherent and purposeful, the game doesn't seem all that enticing, right? Well, yes, and no.The atmosphere and sound design tie it all together very, very nicely! Not only does it nail the isolation, it also leaves something for you to imagine. For example, there are areas with many crates around... Maybe a shipwreck?There are also different types of \"creatures\", each with a different behaviour.And finally, although I don't want to spoil it (please don't read if you're planning on playing the game) the music in the final mission was brilliant! After being alone for so long, you suddenly hear music as you approach home. And it's so good! The only moment in the game in which there is music (hope). After you arrive, there's also the sound of birds and the sea, which you wouldn't have heard in a while...  ... And then there's something else going on with the story that may also intrigue you.But anyway. If you like the feeling on isolation, this game is very well worth a play.Everything from the (simple, but effective) mechanics to the visual and audio design pushed the game toward a specific objective and nailed it. Really enjoyed it!P.S.: Forgot this before. One negative (or at least dubious) aspect of the game was the discovery element, in a sense. When you use the radar, you get the name of the \"points\" on the map. These are like labels, but you don't know what the label does. Unless it says \"mine\", its meaning may be up in the air, to you. Well, I usually abstain from running into things when I don't know what they do, or their names are the least bit ominous. The price for being conservative is death by asphyxiation. Oops. The point is that you will have to risk it and try all of the different labels to know what they do. The dubious part is that you will probably die a couple of times as a result (not as an insta-death type of thing, just for the lack of information, or misinformation -- I didn't pick up some fuel cells because I didn't understand what they were, from their name). It feels a bit strange, since, in that situation, the person would simply die. And it's a bit immersion breaking to have use a \"respawn\" as a planned strategy.It's not too important, but it's a thought I wanted to leave here.",

        "text": "This game totally nails the aesthetic! It reminds me of some old cartoons from the Cartoon Network with the intentionally nasty artstyle and situations.Don't really want to spoil anything, but the game tries to creep you out. The final Boss was particularly cool, for me.I don't really have much to say, as it is a very short game and, as a point n' click, there isn't much to it.Aside from what you see from the screenshots, the game looks really cool in motion due to its lighting system (each object will cast a soft shadow... and, since you're a light-bulb, the shadows move as you move and it creates nice motion)! I also like the choice of colors... color. In general, it's a very cool looking game. What you see is what you get. Lots of organic waste in an otherwise cute cartoon.The music was also very good! I'll be listening to some of the soundtrack later to get what was going on, but, going with the nasty looks, the music has some weird sounds and modulations going on. And it also sounds good, with a great rap song in the credits.The gameplay itself, for me, is the weak point. I mean, it's okay, for the most part. Some of the sections were somewhat frustrating, since you move slowly and rather imprecisely... if there are enemies around, you may make a mistake and have to restart the section. The checkpoints are very frequent, but since there's absolutely no variation to the gameplay, any repetition is too much... Not too much of a problem, honestly.You go from scene to scene, each a short, self-contained puzzle. They're mostly linear and you don't really have much choice in the matter, so you'll go through the interactable objects in order and get things done. Didn't get much out of the story either. Maybe other people disagree?Not a very informative review, but point n' clicks in general aren't my thing. The artstyle interested me, so I gave it a go. It absolutely nails the audio and visuals, so I'd say it's worth a go for that alone!The game itself, though, is nothing special. Would be cool to see how different it would be as a cartoon instead of a videogame.",

        "text": "CaravanSerail might be a good idea for a trading game, but its execution is way off.There are caravans with 3 items constantly passing through your post. Each caravan sets prices differently for their items and your job is to buy and resell whatever you see fit to turn a profit. There are 10 short levels, about half of which are an introduction to the mechanics.These mechanics are, for example, a transformation of items (from a cheapter one to an expensive one), factions and loans, bandits attacking your fort from time to time, etc. Nothing too complicated.If the game wasn't as loose, though, each of these may have provided quite an additional challenge (in a good way).I found out I'm quite conservative -- the first half of the game, I was selling things very close to the price that I bought them by, trying to observe everyone's price on a certain item, etc. etc. It took me quite a bit to finish the levels. Once I decided to risk it, though, I managed to beat the last levels in maybe a minute... which is not a good sign for game.Big spoilers ahead -- may be enough to make you avoid the game entirely.The problem is, as I've mentioned, how loose the game is. You don't really need to pay attention to prices, as the game suggests. Instead, buy everything and sell it at a 150% price, for example. Higher may work as well, I wasn't very precise in my playing -- did not much time to be, either.So, at this point, I start buying the most expensive stuff -- instead of buying items that cost 20-50, I buy things that cost 100-500 and get a high profit very quickly.Once you figure that out, all of the tension and planning is gone. You don't have to take all of these other mechanics into account, which is unfortunate. It all becomes very simples and rather boring as a result.So, another thing is how short the game is: 1 hour is what it took me, with a very slow first half.10 levels isn't enough to explore the mechanics. And the game doesn't really exploit most of its option: even if the game is very easy to \"cheat\", multiplayer would get everyone on the same level, which may open the doors to some more interesting gameplay. Everyone will start out with the same easy exploits -- figure out a way to beat them!So yeah. The idea may be cool, but it's way too crude, as is. The framework is there, but there needs to be a lot more work put into making it an actually good game.",

        "text": "Insanity's Blade is not an awful game, and it may entertain you for a couple of hours if you need a dose of old-school sidescrollers.The problem is the general pacing and level design (not to mention the story, which, coupled with the pacing, makes it a very disorientating game... for me, anyway).The game is very unbalanced, in a similar way to Jets N' Guns: the difficulty peaks at the second or third level, but once you get past that point, you snowball out of control. Now, Jets N' Guns kept being interesting (somewhat) by its huge selection of guns and the joy of trying all the different combinations, which is something not present here. While there are weapons, they're all the same (maybe with a different damage stat? it was never relevant).The levels seemed like an excuse to throw enemies at you, with irregular terrain to give an illusion of change. But, since most of the enemies don't do much aside from walking straight into you, it quickly becomes a matter of pressing forward while continuously attacking. The bosses follow a similar pattern -- while the first couple of bosses were cool, and you actually had to predict what he was going to do -- most of them will die by spamming attack, once the snowball effect sets in.Not much more to say about it. The levels didn't really have a rhythm to them, or a reason. You simply choose the next stage and blast your way through 15 times. It's unfortunate that there isn't more to it...The music was cool, and the visuals had some strengths as well. It was enjoyable for a bit! But, overall, I don't see this as worth a purchase, if you're looking for a good game. If you just want to pass the time, why not?, give it a go.P.S.: The second level, despite being much harder than the others, in my opinion, was by far my favourite. It wasn't a stellar level, but it did seem to have a more careful design. My problem with it was due to having 0 lives, and thus a miss-step would end up with me repeating the whole level (a level with instant spike deaths and a bossfight, etc. etc.)... Despite all that, it had some simple platforming sections, and had you fighting enemies in a corridor where you did have to do some manoeuvering to succeed in.Not perfect, but certainly where I would point to, if I needed to explain the presence/lack of level design.",

Guess you could say \"purity\" and expect to run with it, but come on... And I don't mind games that are light on gameplay (on the contrary!), but there needs to be a purpose to it. There's nothing here.The powerups aren't interesting at all, merely a way of getting you to a previously gated area. There's no challenge other than looking for secret cubes, if you're interested. But even those, it's just a question of looking at every object's corners... Sorry, can't see anything worth while here...

        "text": "Grow Home is a surprisingly special game! It seems to be hit or miss for most people (mostly because of the controls), but it sets out to do something and it does it really well!There were mainly 2 things that I loved: the controls, and the growing aspect.The rest of the game was cute, but mostly there to let you explore the other 2 aspects, in my eyes. The controls, as I've mentioned, are very hit and miss. You're controlling a robot. A clumsy robot. Very clumsy. And it can feel frustrating, for some people. On the other hand, just look at it! The animation is spot on! B.U.D. (the robot) waves his arms around, trying to regain balance in a very natural way. And, if you stick with it, you'll actually feel more in control later on, when you get used to its movement.The procedural animation is awesome, and makes the climbing feel really satisfying, although a bit repetitive, at times.You'll have to move both arms independently, grabbing with one while letting go with the other, etc. Later on, once you feel confident enough, you'll be leaping around, doing some tight, but satisfying, jumps.Then, the growing aspect: this is something that I particularly like, in general. The persistency can be really awesome, when you look back to what you've had (or, in other games, when you see how the world changed based on several people's paths). It's not just about beating a set of levels. You'll have a lot of freedom to grow branches to reach several rocks, or simply fly around, and in the end you can essentially trace it all to what you were doing previously, and why. Not only that, but it also gives some creative freedom, if you want to grow a stylized tree. The potential is certainly there!Despite it's low-poly look, looks great as a result of its lighting system and long draw distance.On the less noteworthy side, for me, is the level design and categorization of fauna/flora. There are different plants growing in different places, and some animals spread around. Your job is to grab them and take them to a machine to analyze them.While their movement and general expressions are cool (on the animal's sides), it's really just an excuse for you to go out and explore every corner of the world. And ... well, it works in doing just that!It tries to extend the game a bit more, by then adding seeds and crystals, etc. etc. I'm not too fond of it, but hey, it's there for whoever just wants to keep exploring! The crystals, in particular, could be hard to find (the last ones), but they also gave you cool and useful abilities, so there's a good tradeoff.I heartily disagree with the length complaints. I mean... the game does exactly what it should. And there isn't any other game like it. Besides, extending the game for the sake of it would only make it more repetitive by the end.The length felt really good to me. And, if I want, I can always go back a grow some more branches and fly around.It's great. If any of this mumbled text appeals to you, get it. I enjoyed far more than I thought!",

        "text": "Not much to say about this one Robot Exploration Squad is a metroid-vania that while not bad, doesn't really add anything, nor does anything particularly well.The aesthetic is, as you may imagine from the screenshots, serviceable, but not really... focused? The areas and atmosphere (along with the music) don't really push the game toward a certainly feeling or idea. It's just there.The power-ups weren't anything special (they were either statistical upgrades (+armor/damage), or keys to acess new areas), but they were very one-dimensional. A counter-example would be Guacamelee, in which the abilities you gain are important in both combat and platforming in major ways.The level design is alright, nothing wrong there either. Yet, again, it wasn't particularly meaningful or well done. It's solid, for sure! The areas connect well, there are a few secrets, your progress is fairly controlled, etc. etc.There were some details in the game feel that I liked (the way the vegetation flew all over when you cut it was cool), and the jump, while floaty, had some fine control to it.One thing I really disliked was the last boss-fight not having a checkpoint close to it. Fortunately, I only died once. But having to go through several challenging rooms and spending minutes before being able to get to the boss is really not a good way of doing things. At least not in this context. It was inconsistent (never in the game was this a thing) and artificially makes the boss harder.EDIT: There is a save-point, according to the developer, it's just not explicit!If you just want a very simple metroidvania to pass the time, sure, this can do the job. But there's a general lack of purpose in it... nothing seems to be there for any particular reason. It's a metroidvania for the sake of being a metroidvania, and never really tries to add or excell anywhere. For the developer: please, don't be discouraged by this. The game is certainly functional. And it's complete, which is already something. But I'd rather play a game that has more to say, instead of being yet another one in the crowd.",

        "text": "Elliot Quest is essentially the second Zelda game, on the NES.It feels old, and it's intended. While it does have some more modern features (the checkpoints, for instance), it doesn't really try to do much beyond being a Zelda tribute, and a really hard one at that!I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, entirely. I beat the main story, but I gave up on the last \"end-game\" Boss, out of frustration. The pay-off wasn't very alluring either.The problem isn't the Boss itself, but all of the little problems around the game that make big fights a problem.I won't go into details about most of it, so don't consider a review. These are just some of my thoughts about the game, and one aspect that might make the game worth it, for you.If you're looking for that old-school, very hard experience, go for it! Including some of the very cryptic puzzles, and being lost and disorientated for hours.The game is somewhat like a metroidvania. You have an overworld separated into areas. Each area, then, is separated into other areas, these being gated by several of the items you will acquire on the adventure. It gets very confusing, because you'll see many \"gates\" throughout the areas, and when you get the item, you have no idea where the gate was. There are also many gates for little upgrades, to make matters even more confusing.Nothing too unusual for NES-like games.Anyway, my problem was mostly the checkpoint system: it doesn't restore your HP fully. Nor your mana. Only half of it. So, if you die in a boss, you'll be handicapped. The only way of getting HP/Mana then is either to kill enemies, or go into a town to buy potions/rest. You can imagine how incredibly frustrating this is. It's a waste of several minutes each time you die, if you want a decent shot at the later bosses!Not to mention you can only carry 2 potions at any time, and these are not replenishable at checkpoints. So yes, it's a far too punishing checkpoint system for me to bother with that one Boss fight. I endured through all the others, but after 5 bosses, the 6th one was too much. Death from a thousand cuts, I guess.So, rant is over. So far, you have my reasons for not enjoying it (well, the ultimate reasons, although there were several little reasons throughout -- old design. I don't like it, but I expected it from this game, so no hard feelings!)The thing that surprised me -- and the reason for me being writting about the game, right now -- was the end-game. Things you can do after you beat the story. Technically, you should do it before, but it's much harder than the final boss, so you might as well...Anyway, you can collect these little crystals that are very well hidden. Either hidden, or behind a very cryptic puzzle, and mostly isolated (as in, the game doesn't prepare you for those types of puzzles). It's cool. It's supposed to be hard, and the ultimate challenge.What I loved about it, was how \"grand\" it felt, in a way. I was simply exploring, after collecting some crystals, and saw a door that required crystals to enter (there are many). I entered a completely different area, and discovered even higher upgrades than the ones you encounter through the normal story. Then Bosses! I was pumped. It reminds me of the Legendary aspect of Pokemon, where you go into these secluded areas and find ancient monsters to either capture or simply beat.Plus hidden stores, etc.I wasn't expecting that at all and it seems like something games don't really do much, anymore. PC games, anyway. The whole end-game seems rather lost. The story guides you through all of the upgrades, and after you beat a game, there's isn't anything \"bigger\" beyond it.So yeah, sorry for ruining the surprise! Regardless, if this seems something you enjoy, get the game -- but know what you're getting into.",

        "text": "Swords & Crossbones was a very interesting game for me to play. It's basically a \"Tactics\" game, following the Final Fantasy Tactics combat-style, which is essentially taking a normal JRPG and adding terrain to its combat. Now, units actually move around, have AOE abilities, etc. etc. which adds quite a lot of depth to the more traditional JRPG combat, with a few new interesting possibilities.I have not played any of the tactics game, but I remember one of my friends playing it. This game made me want to go back to those games (which I'll do, sooner or later, now) in a very unexpected way.The ideas of the game are cool, and I really had a blast in the beginning. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the mobile roots of the developing team, the game ends up falling apart after a couple of hours. It's full of potential, though! Especially since it's a genre that I don't think I've ever seen on PC (not often, at the very least).I won't write a long review, just focusing on a couple of points that I feel were very relevant when I was playing.Going against some other reviewers, who claimed the game to be both \"deep\" and \"casual\"... well, I wouldn't call it depth, as much as breadth. The game does a lot of different stuff. Not only does it have the Tactics combat, but it also has a city-builder element, where you must manage resources in order to build a growing island, to construct buildings that provide resources or upgrade possibilities for your characters. It also has some exploration element, where you sail to find new islands (unfortunately purely linear, going along with the story), and some other repeatable quests.I disagree with the \"depth\" because of a single, yet huge problem with the game: the combat is too easy. I've spent most of the game without even knowing there were abilities (the game explains everything in the first 30 minutes, while some of the things are unlocked hours after the fact... later), and even then, the combat provided no difficulty at all.This is mostly a problem when you realize that the whole upgrade/skill system is rendered pointless. Which, in turn, renders most of the city building system pointless as well.It lacks depth in the sense that you'll never have to think about the combat situations you're in. The game is also very much extended by repetition (again, mobile roots), keeping you stuck in the gameplay loop of discovering islands to unlock more upgrades, to discover more islands, to get more upgrades, ad infinitum.Well, not again infinitely, but for far longer than it should.So, except a lot of the same battlefields, enemies, etc. while at the same time requiring no thought to get through it.It has an interesting button: auto-combat. The AI isn't very good, but it works. 5 hours in, I stopped playing most battles. There was no point. I just hit the little button, and very sub-optimal AI would do the obligatory grind for me!This is not enough, since the UI requires you to still click quite a lot of times to get the auto combat started. There are a bunch of problems created by the previous one. Random encounters during exploration, some obligatory battles while you're doing the main quest, etc. etc.If the combat was well tuned, it might have been good.Unfortunately, the game is mostly a skinner box. It would almost work better as a clicker game.And this is all very unfortunate, but it's a useful example to have, I guess.The game seems very cool. The visuals are pleasant, the writing was actually good (I was laughing at the start of the game! And I rarely appreciate the writings in videogames), and the various system had incredible potential. The combat system and skills may have even been good, if the enemy encounters were balanced. As they're not, the game turns into a huge, huge grind... There's no point.I apologize for just hitting the same point over and over and... But that is the single problem that ruined the whole game, for me. If it was shorter, I would have enjoyed it, as I would not have experience much down town. While I was learning the systems, it was cool! After that, the game couldn't keep up and still extended itself (rather artificially) for a good 10+ hours.You have a bunch of characters, equipment upgrades, etc. You never get to explore any of it. With all this said, I look forward for the developers' next game. This was so close to being great... hopefully, they'll take similar concepts, but with a larger focus on the game's core, instead of all systems that are mostly skinner boxes.",

        "text": "Aerannis is a stealth focused platformer with very mild metroid-vania elements, set in a dystopian future where monsters control the world in a purely matriarchal society ... what?Yeah, it's weird. It's clearly very influenced by anime... whether or not that's a positive, it really depends on the player.The game is full of symbolism, most of it very obvious, but it's certainly different from most platformers out there!Thematically, it's mostly about control, and it also inverts the gender issues that have been popping up in the gaming scene... I don't see it doing anything special in that regard, but hey, it's novel!The game reminds me a lot of Read Only Memories (it even features an advertisement for the game!), mostly in the UI design, not only the visual aspect, but also all the sound effects. That is yet another recent dystopian sci-fi game that tries to incorporate gender and discrimination issues into the mix. I don't really mind them, but it's a bit too \"in your face\", in my opinion. In both games, actually. Feels forced to me, but hey, maybe you'll feel different about it! I won't get into that any more than I already have.As a stealth game, it's certainly not very good. It's decent, at best. It's not really frustrating, so you can get through the game without being constantly reminded of its problems, which is good. I'll get into that later.What is left, however, is its presentation. It's really cool!The visuals, you can judge from the screenshots. There are some details I really like: the windows and the trees, for example. The monster/robot designs are also cool, in places.If I had to mention something that I dislike is how it's very... busy/confusing, at times. I think it's the perspective on some buildings and background/foreground elements that were very disorientating in the larger areas. The game could definitely do a better job in differentiating between background/foreground elements, as well as what the character can or can not grab.Not much more to say about it. It has a distinct style, despite the somewhat overplayed 8/16 bit graphic style. I liked this one, for sure!Now, the music was also great! Nothing mind-blowing, or noteworthy in its use, but it fit the overal aesthetic very nicely! Once again, reminded me of R.O.M., and probably one of this game's highlights, for me!As for the gameplay, it's a simple 2D shooter. You can walk, jump and shoot forwards, that's about it. It's simple, but it does manage to build a solid experience around it.You can grab enemies, if you're close to them (and remain undetected), and you can kill them with a single shot. You'll also have 3 throwable weapons: 1 for distraction, a sticky bomb, and a boom-erang (yeah, it's a bomb too).The metroid-vania elements are very, very light, as I mentioned. You'll get the ability to wall jump, and 2 of the 3 throwable weapons are also \"unlocked\" throughout the story. There are a couple of upgrades spread around the levels, but they're all very mild (slightly faster fire-rater, slightly more hp, etc.). It's mission based, to the whole point of exploration and backtracking present in something like Metroid isn't there at all. The upgrades are also almost negligible in comparison.So yeah, nothing that enhanced the experience by a lot, but hey...Finally, the stealth. This is where I have most issues with. Why? Because Mark of the Ninja exists. I'm not saying to go play Mark of the Ninja instead (although you probably should, if you're simply looking for a stealth game), it's more about how much MotN can teach about 2D Stealth. There are tons of little details that Aerannis is lacking that become rather obvious after playing through MotN.I've already mentioned the ledge highlighting. There's also (and this was a very important one, to me) how much you can see of the room. The camera simply follows your character, and there's no way of looking up/down/left/right. It's very annoying! Especially when the camera something doesn't lock in the same place, despite the character begin in the same spot. So you'll have to walk a bit more to the right to see what is going on, etc. It's not very good, especially when you do need to see where enemies are going.The game also doesn't respond to anything outside your view... like old NES games, where bullets disappear as soon as they leave the screen. This isn't as extreme, but enemies don't seem to take damage for bombs thrown outside your vision, for example. Neither from bullets. It seems like a pointless limitation, especially in a stealth game that relies on planning and sometimes setting traps.There are other minor faults, like the dumb AI that can act very comically at times. I often just jumped up and latched onto a light and saw them walk around for a bit, as if I had disappeared. At those times, you can also thrown bombs down and kill the enemies outright. I did provide a funny moment, when a guard, immediately after running around stopped a wondered \"What is lunch today?\". The AI sometimes gets stuck in a position without ever turning, which can make it impossible for you to pass undetected, although going back to the previous checkpoint easily fixes it. Checkpoints are very common, so you'll never lose much progress.So yeah, the AI is both exploitable and sometimes get into very annoying positions.The controls aren't very good, either. They're okay, but anything that requires either reflexes or precision will soon be met with disappointment. Thankfully, there aren't many sections that do require precise controls. Overall, it certainly hinders the game as a whole, combined with the stealth/visibility and AI problems... With that said, as a whole, I still enjoyed Aerannis. Not the best game I've played, recently, but certainly did a couple of things differently than many platformers today, and looks promising, if the developer keeps improving!If you like the look of it, give it a go.",

        "text": "I got the key from the developer to review the game.Bladestar is a simple and to the point shoot 'em up and, while it does nothing to standout from the average, it manages to be competent in what it does -- with the exception of the very obfuscating backgrounds and poor choice of colors throughout. This makes it fall into the \"No\" category, but it may still appeal to fans of the genre.Presentation-wise, it tries to be a more modern, realistic looking game, against the many 8/16-bit games that most people are saturated with. Most of the models are nothing to write home about, once again being rather generic. The alien ships are the exception, which look pretty cool! Unfortunately, they're only present in the third stage of the game.It has a nice lighting system, which surprised me when I saw my ship actually casting shadows onto other ships and responding to explosions and the like. The problem is that it only affects ships, which, let's be honest, is barely noticeable in a frantic shmup!A minor complaint I have is regarding the visual effects on power-ups: for explosions, shields, etc. the particle effects fit with the general theme -- when you pick power-ups, on the other hand, a few pixel-y particles are created, which seemed like a weird choice... not too important, but still something to be fixed.Still in the visual department, here's the game's biggest problem, to me: the backgrounds.First off, they're just a couple of static layers with parallax -- nowadays, something more could surely be done! The backgrounds simply loop, which is very obvious when you see the same huge planet scrolling for the fourth time.The real problem, though, is how they always make bullets incredibly hard to see, and even to distinguish between different color-coded weapons and power-ups.Each level has a theme. For consistency, both the backgrounds and the enemies' colors are the same. While this makes some sense, it also throws visibility out the window!The first level was okay. The others, however, were all a problem. The third level had green splashes on the background, which blended with the enemies' green bullets. The fourth level was in a debris field -- where most of the obstacles in the level were debris as well! I often got hit because I couldn't distinguish a real obstacle in front of the background...The weapon pick-ups come in different translucent colors, making them blend with the backgrounds as well. This is a problem, as you'll often either pick-up a type of weapon you don't want, or pick up a weapon because you didn't even see it!It was by far the biggest source of frustration I had with the game. Not being very appealing, visually, is fine with me, but when it obfuscates the screen in such a precise genre, it bothers me a lot! Hopefully, the devs can fix this! Tone things down a bit.The music didn't really stand-out to me. It was simply background music, in no way connected with the game. The sound effects were serviceable as well, nothing too wrong with it. The levels seemed a bit off, at times, with some explosions being much louder than the other effects (mostly the end wave explosions), but  nothing that bothered me too much.Separate sliders for the music, voice and sound effects are always welcome, which the game had!Control-wise, the game is pretty good! I played with a controller, and it responds well to the analogs, actually behaving like one!The menus are not controlled with a controller, but a couple of clicks and you're in the game anyway. Would be better if it existed, but hey...It's very straightforward, you move and you shoot. That's about it. There's an auto-shoot button, which is good! For the most part, I had that on, but the later levels did require finer control!Onward to the actual game, now.You control a ship that can only have one weapon at a time, out of 3 available. You can also have up to 2 drones at your side, each of them adding a bullet. There are 2 types of shields: one covering your whole ship, and small spheres that orbit around your ship. The former is destroyed when you're hit, while the latter can block bullets and stay strong, only being destroyed when it collides with an obstacle. All of these drop during the levels.To beat a level, you don't actually need to destroy anything. There are little blue orbs that fall randomly that you need to collect X of to end each wave. Each level has 10 waves + a Boss fight. Needless to say, you actually do need to kill the bosses!This little mechanic changes things a bit, but not enough to seem meaningful, in my opinion.Weapons have different levels. Whenever you pick up a weapon, its level is incremented, and they max out at 8-10, if I recall correctly. This is an interesting thing. If you focus too much on pick only one type of weapon, you may have problems later, if you pick up a lower level weapon! On the other hand, if you want to balance them all out, you have to play slower, waiting for the weapons to drop.There are various types of enemies as well. Some shooting ships, asteroids, and mines. The mines I've found the most interesting, gameplay wise.With asteroids and ships you know what to expect. Mines, on the other hand, come with 2 types: EMP and ... bullet-shooting mines, for lack of an elegant word.EMP mines destroy all of your ships if they're destroyed. The other mines explode into bullets, one in each of 8 directions. Higher level weapons not only do more damage, but also have a larger spread -- which refers back to my previous point of not wanting to shoot in later levels. Something, it's best to play safe, keep your shields up and dodge for a while! Moreover, it also gives you a reason not to have drones/orbiting shields. These will explode a mine when they hit. As you can imagine, they also make avoiding mines far more difficult, if you're in a tight spot. So, once again, in later levels, I had to change my style significantly, by not picking up drones nor shields, for more maneuvering space!From what I've written, so far, you can certainly see the potential! It's simple, but it does have a few elements working together, leading to interesting strategic choices. Unfortunately, the visibility was a huge issue. For example, I often blew the bullet-mines up without even seeing them (leading to a chain-effect). You can see things going wrong fast.That, with the levels being crowded (read: difficult), it was infuriating, at times!Finally, the progression and upgrade system.Something I disliked quite a lot is how your power-ups/weapons always reset when you beat a level. I mean, if I beat the first level, I should be able to carry things onto the next one, right? The upgrade system is also very, very lackluster (to the point of making me wonder if should even be there). When you beat a stage, you have 1 point to spend in: 1 (of 2) more lives; +1 level on one weapons when you start a level; +1 wave orb, etc.Seeing that in each level you'll collect probably around 10+ weapons, starting with +1 seems a bit... pointless?You'll also have 4 or 5 points to spend, max. It's ... barely noticeable, unless you spend every point in one single weapon!Then, you also gain experience points. These can be spent on more lives (max of two), a \"secret\" level, and ship skins.Why not have a more fleshed out upgrade system with which to spend experience? I don't understand.Of course, the levels would require a different kind of balance if the upgrade system was actually meaningful but... that's the point of upgrades, isn't it? Because, as is right now, you can experience the full range of your ship's abilities in the first level! After that, there's no \"exploration\" anymore, and it boils down to a precise grind to beat each level (which is valid, but, in this case, it seems like the two approaches are conflicted).The game has potential, but there are conflicting design choices, and the visibility, once again, \"killed\" things for me.",

        "text": "This is one of the most \"complete\" indie games on Steam, without a doubt! It takes a fairly simple genre, top down-shooter, and does as much as it wants with it! And what's nicer is that by showing how much the game can do, it also opens up quite a lot more that can be done... Sometimes it seems like a genre has \"hit its limits\" ... and then a game like this comes and throws that all way, it's pretty great!Basically, it's a Top-down Space Shooter with physics-based movement (you need to use your thrusters rather than WASD), and quite complex ship customization with various \"classes\" that change gameplay a lot!Each class has several hulls, each with different configurations which you can customize with parts. There must be hundreds of parts, half of which I haven't even unlocked.But basically, there are active and passive abilities, each with a power \"number\". Each slot on the ship has a type and capacity, and you'll need to play with it to find a good combination of pieces for each slot.You can have a melee focused ship that grabs enemies, or one that uses flails that follow you around and do massive damage; you can be a rogue, staying invisible until you shoot ships with a very powerful laser; you can be a pyromaniac, trying to set ships on fire to overheat them; you can be an AOE focused ship, with large attacks and gravity shifting abilities... I could go on, but you get the idea. And even each of these types can have drastically different abilities, since you can fine-tune everything!The game also has quite a lot of game modes, including online (which, unfortunately, is deserted) and arcade. Using the game's mechanics, it recreates several classic arcade games like Breakout and Asteroids, for example. On the online side, you have a MOBA-like mode, as well as Horde modes, either wave based or zombie-based, where the game overwhelms you with mindless enemies... It's really fun!It also has a 20+ hours campaign, that has some interesting aspects! For example, the tutorial lasts 3hours, or more. But it's a meaningful part of the game! It's not the game simply holding your hand -- it's your character learning about the universe with you. Meeting \"veteran\" characters, and getting some lessons with them, while experiencing significant parts of the story. It's great! And I've found it a very nice way of teaching the player as much as you can, while integrating it into the overall purpose of the game.This long tutorial is also necessary, as the game can be quite overwhelming. I played this back in 2013/2014 for around 7 hours. I've done little more than the tutorial, in that time (it was much faster the this time around). Yet, when the tutorial ended, the game seemed to throw me into the wolves -- the ship customization. That's what I think it under-tutorialized, as it was overwhelming to the point of me putting the game aside for a year or two.That said, this time I tried a little harder and actually experimented with various ships, not minding a few lost missions - and it's brilliant!Any time you get stuck on a mission, try changing things around. Try a different type of ship, perhaps one more suited to the mission. Nowadays, it seems I'm too used to games being very clear and to the point, never having to experiment and try things for myself. This one is different, and it was quite daunting. But it's certainly worth it!The game also has you try different premade ships during the campaign, in some special missions. It helps, at least to give you an idea of what each type is capable of, this giving you a starting point.The game has dozens, if not hundreds, of missions. Each of those can be completed in just a couple of minutes, most of the time, never stretching over 10minutes. However, there are locations with chains of missions, if you will, to keep things significant.The cool part if that each missions has several bonus objectives, acting as challenges. Some are time-based, carnage-based, etc. It gives you a lot of room for replayability and challenge that isn't simply tied to \"how much HP/damage to enemies do\", which is always great! The only bonus challenge I didn't like was the one, present in several levels, about \"Complete the level without using a Sage ability\"... Your character is a Sage. Some type of special dude in the universe and whatnot. As a Sage, you have one of various special abilities, like Time Warp. These are special in the sense that they're mostly unique, different from your enemies and ship parts. They make the game more interesting. And yet, the game often asks you not to use it... With me trying to do some bonus objectives, I got in the habit of never using it, even outside missions with such an objective. It's discouraging players from using a significant part of the game and I don't understand why anyone would want to do that. But anyway, it's not major, especially being optional! It's just a form of (dis)couragement that should be used to guide the player into exploring the mechanics, not the other way around, in my view.There's quite more to say about the game, but that's the problem, haha!The music is pretty good, and the visuals even better! Despite being very simple looking, the game makes good use of a few modern effects that certainly makes it stand-out, for me! Every object casts soft shadows from the large stars in the background, and the backgrounds are composed of several layers, each of them animated, yet not distracting. It's great!Honestly, I was overwhelmed with the game, the first time I played it. But if you can keep going after that initial wall, it has incredible depth, and definitely changes things around in an otherwise stale genre!I'd place it up there with SPAZ, regarding some of the best, recent top-down space shooters with a focus on customization.Definitely get it, especially when it's on sale!",

        "text": "I've heard quite a bit about how Shadowrun: Dragonfall was the proper installment of Shadowrun: Returns, after the first game having felt rather empty, despite the great engine.Well, it certainly is better, in my opinion. But not by a whole lot.The story seems bigger, with higher stakes, but it suffers from weird pacing. Take something like Dragon Age (the first one): you start small, and you end up saving the world, more or less. SR: Dragonfall is similar, but there's a huge leap between rookie and hero, in the later. In Dragon Age, you had to traverse the whole world, trying to unite the various races to help you. It was a long journey, with tons of sidequests in between.In SR:D, you start by helping your little town, and suddenly you're saving the world, and fighting some \"bigger than life\" enemies. It didn't feel very natural, to me...Another problem is how there are still some bugs and inconsistencies in the dialogue. The bugs I encountered weren't particularly harmful, only a bit annoying (although I know of one that can go as far to delete your saves -- only in a mission, and it's very clear in the forums. There's a workaround, so it could be worse. ANYWAY...). The inconsistencies, though, didn't feel good at all. Sometimes, the conversations repeat themselves as if nothing had happened (not just a line or two, but the whole conversation, with several choices in between), and there was even an NPC that told me someone had died, and the next time I talked to it, it talked as if that character was still alive.Still, it's not game-breaking or anything. Just something that stops this from going from good to great.The choices it gave you were pretty surprising, at times. On the other hand, it also seemed to omit some choices that seemed plausible, and would feel much more satisfying.The last thing is more of a personal gripe with the general feel they were going for, but let's say that I didn't like the  AI going from wonderful sentience to being an arrogant killer in a heartbeat. Come on, not again! A machine isn't a human being, it makes no sense for it to always have the same drives as a human being. It's always a power-hungry supercomputer that wants control... There are so many more interesting roads to take... oh well.Other than these things, I really liked the game! I prefered some aspects of Blackguards' combat system. Especially 2: movement and attacking was far more... \"modular\", let's say. In Blackguards, you could break down 1 Action into a few smaller ones, in order to choose a certain path, and so on. Of course, positioning was more important in that game, but anyway: Shadowrun sometimes felt a bit awkward as a result. For example, you can walk and attack with a single action, but only automatically! The game doesn't let you choose the path, or anything. The more important aspect of this would be where you're attacking, since that's the position you'll stay in when the enemies' attack. The second is how the percentages in Shadowrun were far lower! It's infuriating! It got better by the end, but for the majority of the game, it seemed like my hit rates were always 40-60%... This results in a lot of misses, which everyone should hate. But at the same time, it provides a certain thrill... it works.All in all, it's a very solid game! Nothing revolutionary, but it has a great atmosphere, with both awesome visuals and music! The combat isn't very deep, but it certainly provides some nice challenges.The story had its ups and downs, but I liked some aspects of it. If it seems up your alley, give it go!",

        "text": "This is a blast to play! Having played Hard Reset, I can say that Shadow Warrior has a similar approach, but, with a far more visceral combat, cutting demons left and right, with lots of blood and parts flying around.It's really awesome! The starting weapons are rather overwhelming, but you'll get much more fun ones about 3 or 4 levels in.My personal favorite, as usual, is the bolt weapon. There's something really satisfying about impaling enemies in a bolt, pinning them against a wall and watching their members jiggle... Heh.The Katana is also pretty great! You have directional attacks, and the dismemberment is really precise as well.The levels are rather long, usually in the range of 40minutes to 1 hour. Still, you can Save at any time, so it's fine.Lots of secrets and easter eggs to look for as well, many of them being throw-backs to the original Shadow Warriors. ... It also  features a demonic Monty Python rabbit.. That can only enchance a game. Every game.You'll be able to upgrade weapons and other special abilities, altough the upgrade system didn't seem particularly good, to me. Not that it's very important, anyway! The weapons don't start out bad, waiting for you to upgrade. Usually you upgrade to get additional forms of attack and whatnot, so it's fine.The only thing that I didn't like at all was one aspect of the boss fights. They were really cool, usually multi-phase fights, where you fight enormous bosses, focusing on destroying a certain piece of armor, and then damaging it. They were really huge, which is awesome!The problem is simply that, after you destroy a piece of armor, you need to focus on it's weak point. But, even in their \"down\" state, the bosses still move and attack, and often even block their weak point! Meaning that, even if you try to hit it, you'll often miss. Not to mention that those hitboxes are very weird, often not registering what seems a valid shot... So yeah. That's annoying!After a couple of seconds, the armor regenerates 100%, so you'll have to go through the same old song n' dance of shooting armor, and then missing the weak point miserably... It's infuriating. But other than that, the bosses were well designed and satisfying! Just he implementation that left a bit to be desired.Two possible solutions are: instead of time before regenerating, perhaps a damage counter would work -- although it's rather artificial... the boss could be down for much longer (a balance of the two, perhaps?); the other one, which I prefer, would be not to regenerate the whole armor. It could come back, but it would take significantly less damage before breaking -- this would accelerate the fight, and not in a bad way, I'd say. The other thing I'll mention is how some of the encounters felt really unfair! For the most part, the difficulty was great! I played the whole game in Hard Mode and, while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating. There were perhaps 3 or 4 encounters that threw too much at the player, especially the biggers, invulnerable enemies that you need to focus on a specific point/strategy to beat -- throw a few of them, and it's infurating, as you can't really focus on anything in particular. Especially in closed spaces, where you can't even maneuvre. But again, that rarely happened, so it's all good!I almost forgot to mention: it's looks really, really good! The lighting effects are pretty nice, but what was very impressive was the mirroring effects. Water can reflect the game's environment, and there are also lots of crystal/glass effects that distort it -- it looks really awesome! Performance was good (solid 60fps) with the exception of fights with lots of dismembered enemies, where the physics could slow it down a bit.Other than that, it has additional modes, including survival, new game plus, and an hardcore mode where you can't save, with a much higher difficulty. There are 4 difficulty modes (+ plus harcore), with Insane above Hard. One minor complaint is that you can only do NewGame+ on the same difficulty that you've beaten the game with. So, having beaten the game on Hard, I can't start on Insane. I'm not sure if NewGame+ scales the difficulty up. Usually, I like to beat game on a difficulty, and do NG+ above that, to somewhat balance things.But hey, all in all, Shadow Warrior is a really awesome FPS. Not much in the way of story, although it does have one, compensated by one of the most satisfying FPS gameplay around. Lots of cutting and exploding!I'd say I prefer Hard Reset's aesthetic -- and, to a degree, I really like the feel of its, althoughs it's more metallic pieces flying around than ... you know, flesh -- but they both excell at arena shooting, and certainly both achieve an almost perfect feel in 2 vastly different worlds. Definitely get both, if you like FPS!",

        "text": "Blackguards is a turn-based combat focused RPG, that will most likely frustrate you a lot with the amount of dice rolling in it!My opinions won't really add much to the discussion, as they're mixed... like almost everyone else's. Also, I'm farily new to the genre, so the min-maxing aspect present in the attributes and skill-trees in the game don't really appeal to me, yet (mostly how of ignorance, but anyway...).I really like RPGs in general, but I'm not one to read up on the game's numerous systems to learn what the optimal builds are -- I like to shape my characters as I please, leading to some interesting, fun, but not necessarily good decisions. I've done the same in Blackguards and will admit that, for the most part, it went alright. I played through Normal mode, and never got truly stuck, which was my biggest worry.Many people complained about reaching an unbeatable point in the game because they had a sub-optimal build. Maybe they were either playing on Hard, or I've simply been fairly lucky in my decision.I will say that there were lots of details in the game that I simply did not delve into -- potions (offensive), traps, etc. Those didn't seem all important in any of the battles in Normal.Anyway. It's tough. Some of the battles were infuriating, missing 3x in a row when I had a 90% chance to hit, having some periods of extended battles that far overstayed their welcome, etc.But I did enjoy it quite a lot. Until I finished the 3rd Chapter, that is. Then the game offered nothing new.The game is very linear, although it opens up a bit in the 3rd Chapter, giving you quite a lot of sidequests. The following 2 chapters barely have any of those, which felt strange.It seems like the focus of the game was only the 3rd chapter, the other ones being mostly to build it up or simply carry the story.The story was pretty bland, and the sidequests weren't too interesting either. Gameplay-wise, it's almost a pure combat game. You move from battle to battle. Other than battles, you just go to cities to buy equipment/heal/train, and get sidequests. Sidequests simply lead you into more battles. You never explore anything, never really find emergent gameplay or anything of the sort. It's very, very combat focused.But hey... I really have very little to add that would be in any way meaningful. I want to talk about one thing exclusively -- and that is how opaque the game actually was! It was one of the biggest sources of frustration, for me.Sometimes, the game pushes you into extended battles. Battle after battle after battle without an opportunity to heal, restock, change equipment, etc. These, of course, are a much bigger challenge -- especially because, if you do poorly on one battle, you'll carry that penalty onto the next one.These battles felt extremely tense, to me. Sometimes they could go on for 2 hours, even if they were just 2 or 3 battles. The game is very slow paced, and a mistake can cost you quite a lot of time, which is frustrating. And the game often likes to pull tricks on you that it never pointed to. They're unwelcome surprises.This is one side of it. The other, happened in the end of the game. After the point of no return, you're lead into a serious of battles, but you can heal and re-equip between them. What you can not do, is buy anything. Every healing potion, equipment, etc. that you can use is what you've taken with you. There were a few problems here -- first, you had no idea how many battles there would be, so you couldn't really judge. Second, what the game showed you was very misleading, by having it spread over 2 \"pages\", but only showing you the first.Basically, you're expecting x battles, and suddenly, after wasting most of your potions, you're shown that there are actually twice as many. Well, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.Thankfully, the game wasn't tricking the player and ramping up the difficulty artifically -- on that second page, there was a healer and merchant that was essentially a safe point. And that was a very nice thing.The problem is how the game never communicated that beforehand. Every battle I fought felt that much more frustrating because a small mistake seemed like a colossal one. Arguably, that the feeling that the game was trying to carry -- I doubt it, though. In this case, it was simply a case of bad communication with the player, it seemed. And similar issues happened throughout the game -- often leading you into \"extended battles\" without warning, and the like.For me, at least, it's a huge source of frustration, to have to \"judge\" something without information. Especially when mistakes can cost hours.So yeah. That's basically it. The game is a huge \"tension\" without the \"release\"...Regardless, I enjoyed it. I'm not a hardcore player of the genre, so my appreciation is certainly different. It was a good challenge! There was some frustration with the dice-rolls, but overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tough turn based rpg.",

        "text": "Teslagrad is one of the games I've enjoyed the most, recently!It's not perfect, and some of the issues will certainly put some people off, but I found it great.It's a metroid-vania in structure, but a puzzle-platformer in its mechanics. Being a metroid-vania, it already hits a soft spot for me! You have a fairly big map with different areas to explore, gaining several abilities as you progress that let you reach previously undiscovered places.The puzzles mainly revolve around magnetism, as you could guess from the game. It bares some similarities with the game \"Magnetic By Nature\", but, while that game has more ... imaginative puzzles, Teslagrad is more polished, and it stands out with its awesome artstyle and unorthodox story-telling. I haven't found most puzzles to be too difficult, nor the physics to be too unpredictable. Sure, there were a few times that the game was a bit frustrating for execution rather than solving a puzzle. But the difficulty was just right, for the most part. The artstyle has got to be one of my favourites aspects. Reminds me quite a lot of older, hand-drawn cartoons, and it works surprisingly well with a few modern touches in the lighting effects.The music was also really good! Unfortunately, it was a bit sparse, and the sound designed lacked in several occasions. Boss fights especially... while trying to carry a bit more impact by stopping the music right after the fights were over, the game felt a bit empty, while leaving the impact behind. Not something that is easy to explain... PID was great in this regard! Using the music's intensity to carry a given vibe.When I mentioned \"unorthodox storytelling\", I meant the way that the game presents its backstory. There are 36 scrolls hidden in the game, which are usually harder to spot or get to. Most of them, you can see, being alerted to it if you want to get it. Some were completely hidden, sometimes by abilities which you did not have, at the time...More on that next, though!These scrolls are just little cards (almost postcards) with very simple, but representative drawings of this country's history. It shows how things evolved from medieval times to the more developped world, and then crumbling world. I found it really cool, and it certainly gives players the chance of exploring the world by searching for scrolls... twofold.The only problem, as I said, is the gated scrolls. As a result, you'll have to go back right after/before the final boss, and go through the whole game again (-- with all of your abilities and the map explored, though! Still, you'll have to solve many of the puzzles again, even knowing the solution). In more combat-oriented games, it's a great technique! It lets the player feel overpowered by going back to old, previously difficult places. In a puzzle game, traversal is rather annoying.Regardless, most of them are well in your grasp, less than 10 (if that many) requiring backtracking.Not much more to say about it. The game is beautiful, and the puzzles are pretty well designed. Certainly worth a shot if you're into the animation, puzzle-platformers or  metoid-vanias in general!",

        "text": "Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut is a first person puzzle game that is as much Portal as it is NaissancE.It functions essentially like Portal, with sequential, and well defined puzzles. However, when moving from one puzzle to the next, you encounter some pretty huge monocromatic structures, very much like NaissancE.The difference between this version and the previous, is the addition of a story, through voice-acting... I don't think the story is very well put together, in the context of the game, though. It's not bad, but I don't think it is very important, aside from giving the player a break between puzzles.The puzzles are rather eclectic, drawing from several different types of puzzles. It certainly keeps things varied and interesting. Unfortunately, there will inevitably be sections with puzzles that many players may not like.A specific example I can give is some of the physics-driven puzzles... It's always the same problem: instead of very clear cause-effect, you sometimes get weird interactions that make the puzzle much harder and confusing than it should be.I'm also not a fan of sliding puzzles, of which there were a couple.Overall, nothing too bad! Most of the puzzles were pretty good! I liked it. Not much more to say about it, though.The visuals are great, and the music sets a nice atmosphere. It's around 4 hours long to beat the main campaign, but there are some time-challenges and other secret puzzles hidden around that may let you take something more out of the game.Finally, I mentioned the story. Not to spoil too much, it's mostly trying to get doubt into the player's mind, by having 2 people trying to tell him different sides of the story, seemingly leading to a decision in the end. Unfortunately, the game was designed as a straightforward puzzle game. As a result, the story is literally a few lines of voice-acting between areas. It never affects the gameplay. The player never actually chooses anything. Never questions anything. Never explores around to find clues. Nothing.It's just there! And what could be a cool thing, ended up being nothing at all. It's purely a distraction.But hey, this is all subjective. These were my impressions after playing through it. Although not as striking as either Portal nor NaissancE, it does manage a nice balance of both, and it's definitely a good game! Worth a try if you're looking for a first-person puzzle game.",

        "text": "Very cool little game! It has a great vibe, although it wasn't very well communicated, from the start.Death Ray Manta is a very hippie shoot 'em up game. There are no leaderboards and no achievements, meaning you can only compete with yourself! There's also a score cap, which may or may not be your own objective during your time. The game has 32 levels, each with a special collectible that adds a point to your score. The levels get progressively harder and more complex, introducing several subtly different enemies to keep things interesting. I found it really tough! Even thought each levels lasts only for a few seconds, I took 6+ hours to beat it! Everything dies in one hit, but so do you. You can also shoot the enemies' bullets, destroying them.The game is fair, for the most part. I will agree that it can be really frustrating, though! Especially near the end, where I was trying to maximize my score, and got killed after a near perfect attempt... still, it felt really rewarding whenever I beat a new personal record.The only problem I have with it is how the visuals are very aggressive, at first. The game isn't very clear about its objective either, which, combined with all the flashing colors, will make the first few rounds very very short and disorientating. It almost stopped me from playing.... Deciding to give it a go regardless, I certainly don't regret it!It's a very small, but focused game with a single purpose, that it does really well! I'd also like to add that it feels great to play with a controller. It's very fluid and certainly has good feedback with the controller's rumble.If you're looking for a quick shmup, give it a go.",

        "text": "Particle Mace is a neat little arcade game with a more modern approach!I'm not very into arcade or score-attack games, in general, so this is definitely not a game I can get much out of. Regardless, I think it's a pretty good game, getting quite a lot out of such a simple concept.The gameplay is very simple: it's similar to asteroids, but instead of shooting in front of you, you have a bunch of particles tied to you by \"strings\". These particles kill enemies on contact, so you're trying to swing them around you while avoiding collisions.One hit KO ensures pretty fast rounds, for the most part.Aside from the more traditional arcade modes, where your objective is to get the highest score, you get Missions mode. In this mode, you get 3 missions to complete at any given time, out of 150. When you beat a mission, you get another, and so on. This is pretty standard, these days. But Particle Mace gets the upper hand by introducing missions with tweaks to the actual game. For some missions, there are no enemies, asteroids and much bigger, maybe the background color hides certain enemies, maybe you need to race for certain points, etc.The changes are quite varied, and they mostly bring something new to an otherwise repetitive experience, focused on score alone.These missions also unlock ships (and does scoring high on arcade modes). Unfortunately, there few ships, and most of them aren't very usable, in general. Maybe in some specific situations, but I kept using one or two of the ships 80% of the time.Perhaps some more manual customization (with perks) would have worked better. Of course, it would have a different balance, so yeah... The point is just that the ships didn't seem to balance towards one particular direction, but actually be more gimmicky.So far, so good.There are 2 problems that I have with it, though. One of them stopped me playing. The other, I think could have extended my investment in the game, but seems to be tailored towards the score-attackers, which is a shame, as it could have appealed to both!The first is how some of the missions are conflicting with one another. Some are synergistic, but some make others almost impossible. For example, wanting to kill X enemies while having to survive for Y time without particles. You can't kil anything until you beat the latter mission... Some are more subtle, like trying to race through all the points while avoiding killing anything -- they're not mutually exclusive, but close. This problem is aggravated, somewhat, by this being a physics driven game -- It's more unpredictable, leading to some undesirable situations. Nothing new, I guess.But hey, overall, I thought the game was still pretty cool! Unfortunately, when I was at 137/150 missions, I had a set of two missions that made progress literally impossible.I had to survive for 60 seconds (60!) without particles. Also, I had Mega Asteroids that filled the screen. The asteroids closed in on me in less than 5 seconds. There was absolutely no path to take. It's certain death. And there's no failsafe for these situations. The only \"solution\" is to reset all of my progress. Yeah... no thanks.As you can imagine, that's rather annoying. Specially with no accounting for it.This could be solved by, for example, getting some currency for score in Mission Mode, and then using it to \"re-roll\" a mission into another, for example. It would be back sometime later, but you could postpone an immediate problem like this. Either that, or actually disabling a mission.Since it's impossible to make progress, I simply quit playing.The second problem is how the achievements' bar is far, far too high. There are quite a few achievements, but they're *all* for very high scores. You can only start earning some when you've already invested time and effort into it -- sure, that may be the idea of an achievement, which I recognize. On the other hand, achievements can also be a way of keeping people interesting. For me, as I'm not a score-attacker, having some easier achievements to pursue could be good. I'd still be pursuing something, get invested, and then may even by invested enough to go for higher scores. As is, the achievements are purely for higher level players, I guess. Not too big of a deal.Anyway, I've written a bit too much about this game.It's neat, and it works well, for the most part. I definitely feel like 10\u20ac is too much, but since the game is on sale for 19 cents, you should definitely buy it, as it is pretty fun and well made!",

        "text": "Hexcells plus is essentially the same as the previous one, with one key difference, as other people have mentioned: it's much more difficult.This comes with its advantages and its disadvantages. On the whole, though, I'm all for it!For those unfamiliar with the game, it's very similar to Sudoku, which more people are probably familiar with. The big difference is that you don't have the same structure in every game; instead, you get levels with vastly different layouts.There's never a need to \"guess\" or risk a move that might be wrong. If you combine the information at each turn, you'll find at least one correct move.Each moves reveals more information, which forms the game cycle.The first game was too easy. Why? Essentially, because you always had a group of valid moves at each turn. This meant that, even if you missed one or two, you could easily make significant progress. This time around, there's a new mechanic: '?' tiles. These don't reveal useful information.Many people have reacted negatively to this, but it's not as bad as it seems. I would even say it's necessary, to increase the difficulty.This way, you lose the number of valid moves, so you need to combine the more subtle information you get to reach the answer. With bigger levels, information is quite sparse, and you can get some really tricky puzzles.That's basically what Hexcells Plus does that its predecessor did not. The last game was fairly easy, while some of these puzzles can take you tens of minutes, if not an hour.Still, the game is still fair, giving you at least one valid move, if you're carefully looking for it!The biggest \"fault\" I find with this new tile is this: the previous game was surprisingly replayable! Since you always had several moves to make, you could choose very different paths to the solution. Each new path seemeed almost like a new level... which made a puzzle game replayable! That was great.This time, that doesn't happen (not to the same degree, anyway) simply because you have less options. Overall, this is just as great as the previous one! The mentioned disadvantage is undermined by the fact that it's more challeging, and thus brings something new into the formula.",

        "text": "Jets'n'Guns is a shoot 'em up with a very clear purpose: carnage. In this game, you basically go from level to level, absolutely obliterating everything. And it does that well enough!I'm left with 2 minds about it, though, which I believe boils down to 2 things: communication, and progression.Between levels, you have access to the game's shop, where you can buy and sell weapons, ships, upgrades, etc.You never lose money by buying something and selling it afterward, or upgrading and degrading it, etc. The money you earn from missions is permanent. Which means that, if you want, you can completely change your weapons between each mission, if you have enough \"total money\".While the game tries to communicate this, it didn't really seem apparent to me, when I first started. It took me a while to realize it... at which point it was too late.The main problem might be how cheesy and busy the presentation is -- most information seems to be lost, for me. Too many flashing things and rough edges at once.Anyway. The game was bloody hard, in the beginning! It was almost impossible for me to beat any mission. I was playing on Normal, at the second level's Boss. Having a looot of trouble, and I didn't have enough money for a decent load-out, it seemed, to me.So I checked the forums: apparently, the game would be really hard to start on Normal! So, I lowered it to Easy.That was... much better. Some level were still quite a challenge, but it was doable.So, for a while, I just kept gaining money, with a fairly challenging campaign. Then, there came a point when I had enough money to get a pretty good set of weapons and good defense. At that point, I was unbeatable. Every level (a bit after the halfway point, I believe) was just steamrolled. It became really easy! The game also has a looping system -- if you beat it once, it goes up one difficulty level, and you get to keep all of your money/weapons. I beat Normal... much easier than Easy Mode, since I was all upgraded. Then Hard... same deal. Almost impossible to lose.After I beat the game for the third time, I decided it was enough.Level and weapon variety is really high, and while some enemies are just reaskins, there are still a lot of distinct enemies to encounter. There are gimmick levels, secret levels, lots of weapons... The problem was the difficulty. If I had kept playing on Normal, maybe I would have had a much better experience! Instead, the game offered my a Great Wall when I first started, and eventually removed it, making the rest of the game rather pointless.Some levels take away your ship for another, weaker, one. They limit your numbers of weapons, and things like that. Those were the harder levels, on my 2nd+ runs. But they were good! Why? Because they required experimentation.The ship carries a Heat element. Weapons firing generate heat. And so does getting hit. If you're overheated, you can't shoot. So, you sometimes have to balance how much you fire.There are also both mechanical and energy weapons. The latter generated a lot more heat, but are also much more powerful.As you can see, the element of experimentation is certainly there! Unfortunately, the game decided to be hardest at the very first missions, where you don't have money nor experience to experiment... Which lowered the rest of the game by a lot.One simple aspect that I think would benefit the game a lot would be a system of replaying past missions to get a bit more money. It would make experimentation a lot easier, with players replaying missions, while trying different weapons, getting a feel for them, and gaining a bit more money to invest in the process. Sure, it could snowball out of control -- but it already has, for me! Perhaps each time a player played a mission, he would gain only a lowering % of the total money. Or, maybe he could only gain money for the enemies he hadn't killed before, or the secrets he hadn't found. Something along those lines. Encourage experimentation, while keeping the challenge present at all times.As is... I was discouraged at the beginning, and eventually the game just became too easy.Despite all this, the game does one thing really well. It offers a huge array of weapons to try out and upgrade and just blast everything with. It's mindless, crude, and very rough around the edges, but there's still something quite unique here! So yeah, if it seems appealing, definitely give it a go!",

        "text": "Circuits is basically Simon Says, with some fantastic presentation and some very puzzling design choices.Being a game about music, it's right up my alley. I pay a lot of attention to how music is generally used in video-games, so I was somewhat eager to play the game.Unfortunately, despite it being great in a lot of areas, it fails in the most important part: the game. The game and the part that music plays in it is incredibly disappointing, and, to me, it ruins the overall experience.In this game, you are given a level, with some \"holes\" and pieces that you can use to fit those holes. Each piece plays a musical phrase, and your job is to reconstruct the song.You can play the song at any time and go forward/backward to listen to a certain part exclusively. ... And that is the game. \"Monkey see, monkey do\". Or, well... \"hear\". There's nothing remotely interesting in how music is played. It's just a bunch of isolated tracks you have to place in the song. This could be interesting. Music is a creative field, so, perhaps, we could have some similar tracks and try to make our own song... but no! The game often has very similar tracks, playing the same sets of notes, with a very very slight change, but you need to put everything in its \"right\" place. \"Right\" meaning simply the place intended by the designers.If you misplace something, the game will tell you that \"something is wrong\" and you'll have to figure out what.You have hints and you can isolate tracks (except in the last few levels, where the track isolation is taken out, for some reason... \"\"difficulty\"\" purposes, I assume), so you can get help if you make a mistake. But... then the game is telling you what to do. Now, what's the biggest problem with the game?Well, you don't construct the song from zero. You have several tracks already playing. This would be fine, as a baseline for the song, but here's the problem: the backing track is often much louder than the tracks you're trying to fit in the song.Meaning that you often hear the backing track when you're trying to hear what's missing, and it gets frustrating. If you can barely hear what you need, what's the point?!And this happens a lot! Then, there's the second biggest problem. Some of the tracks that you have to choose from are incredibly similar! They play exactly the same notes, in exactly the same intonation, with very similar effects. But perhaps one more note (that fits!) is added, very lowly into the mix, and that track is \"wrong\". This is a very arbitrary wrong. The notes played are the same. The track fits the song just as well as the \"correct\" one. So where's the problem? Why can't I choose it?It's a very artifical way of creating difficulty. And it completely defeats the point in have a game about music, to me.In each level, you have X tracks, and you use them all. So, they're all notes that fit the song, there's no room for error, in that regard. It's literally just about listening (and trying very hard to discern the sound you're looking for amidst the other louder tracks) and putting the only piece in place that fits.... It's really puzzling the me why this plays like it does. Maybe it's a very personal thing, but it seems to destroy what makes music amazing! There's no creativity. It's like a puzzle with every piece masked. The game hides information to increase difficulty, with no real reason.I think I'm just hitting the same keys (heh) at this point. I really dislike the game itself, it seems to go against most of what I love about music.. so that's not good.Now, how would it be better, using similar concepts?Well, let the player build a song, from a set of rules. Perhaps the backing track already have its progression set, and the players have a larger pool of sounds and notes. Maybe the notes he has to place are already set, but the way they're played (instruments, sequences, effects, etc.) are to his liking. Maybe we could build an actual song that would be different from player to player, while obeying certain rules. Give the music space to breathe.With some more thought, I believe this could work. As it is... maybe it does for most people, but certainly not for me. And that's fine!Now, I've been negative enough. The presentation and functionality of the game is actually really good!The minimalist visual style works very well, it looks good and has a very novel, but solid way to presenting information in a pleasant way!The songs themselves weren't much to my liking, but they sounded pretty good (sonically), for the most part! There were a couple of rougher edges in the track not connecting perfectly, but it was nicely done, for the most part!It tries to change introduce a few mechanics, every once in a while, to keep things interesting. The way you can listen to any point of the original song at any point is good, and you can fast forward your own song to listen to the exact part you want. The interface is also fine, as I didn't have any problems with it at all.I truly dislike the *game* and how music is used. And it's the most important part, to me, which is why I don't recommend this.But the developers are clearly capable of a lot, as everything else is very well done!So yeah, I'll be negative for now, but I'll be on the look out for their other games, the talent might be there!",

        "text": "Outland is a metroivania with a surprising Prince of Persia influence, and similar coloring mechanics to those in Ikaruga.I had heard wonders about this game a few years ago, with high praise, urging everyone to buy it from the PSN. Metroidvanias being one of my favourite genre, I've finally decided to give it a try.Although it is a good game, overall, it was rather disappointing, to me. Mostly because of the metroivania aspect. It's... completely unremarkable. The game is incredibly linear, with almost to no backtracking. The powers you get aren't very interesting either, and simply act as a way of gating progress.There are some hidden collectibles and upgrades to your Health and Special Attacks (Fury) bar, but not much is really done with the metroidvania aspects.For example, there are a couple of collectibles and upgrades that require backtracking after you get certain abilities. The problem is that the game never gets you to backtrack. The game itself is linear, so you have to make an effort to go back.You're never lost or just wandering about the areas for your own exploration. The game simply pushes you forward until the very end.It's not interesting. The metroidvania seems a mere label on top of the game, and something that was never explored.So yeah, this was disappointing.However, it's still a pretty good game!The Prince of Persia-esque movement felt surprisingly satisfying! While a bit weird at first, because of how physics-driven it is, it gets much better when you get the hang of it!The art-style is also great, although a bit too repetitive. Colors and the backgrounds change a bit to provide enough variety, but the striking aspect (the sillhouette) does make it somewhat monotonous. It still looked really good, for the most part!The music was also great at setting an ambience, although it didn't go much further than that, for me.I'd rather keep this one short. The game seemed a bit unremarkable, for me. But it does have its great aspects, and it's worth playing if this style of platforming seems to appeal you. And both the art and sound design are far above average, which helps!",

        "text": "This is a weird one. The game itself is pretty unique, and has a few interesting ideas...On the other hand, it's very unpolished and often has contradictory mechanics that end up making the game very tedious.OMG Zombies! is almost like a puzzle game, as it has been said by other reviewers. Each level has a certain layout (there are 100 levels, but much fewer layouts), and a set of zombies. There are several types of zombies, each with a unique destructive ability. Once you kill one, that ability activates, killing more of them around him. It makes for a pretty neat chain effect!The most succint way to describe this game is one with very loose mechanics, but very tight objectives.What do I mean by this? Well, each level has quite a bit of room to breathe, since the zombies start in random positions. Exploding barrels do as well. This makes each restart almost a different level.The game hasn't been carefuly tailored for you. While that has its negatives, it can create some pretty surprising situations and chains that one couldn't predict!And I like that a lot!On the other hand, you unlock level by getting Gold medals on specific levels. These gold medals are awarded for killing 90+% of the zombies in the given level. That's where the randomness and \"breathing room\" creates a problem. It's often very unlikely to achieve that goal without some starting positions.Another problem is how unclear it is the chain that you'll create. Each zombie is moving randomly, and their range isn't very clear. So, it's nigh unpredictable. All of this boils down to luck, in the end.You restart until you have a good starting position, and then you try to judge which shot will have the biggest effect.... Then, there's the upgrade system. You upgrade each zombie  with credits you earn from medals. The shinier the medal, the more money you get. This could have been a cool feature, but it fell short for a simple reason:each zombie has 3 stats to upgrade, but you don't get to choose which! It's automatic. This stops any possible creativity in upgrading certain zombies in a certain way to develop your playstyle. It's also very grindy in the late game, since you need to perfect almost every level to upgrade everything.The biggest problem, perhaps, is that there are 100 levels. This is far too much. Simply because the game is pretty repetitive. Lots of similar zombies exploding. The levels tend to get dilluted pretty fast, and instead of creating interesting situations, it's simply tedious to grind through them all.Not to mention how perfecting a level often end in you waiting up to several minutes for the 2 remaining zombies to align so you can explode both of them with your last bullet....Aside from this, there are other technical problems that don't help. Visually, the game is really weak.It has a solid aesthetic, it was what appealed to me at first! But the actual quality is poor. The game is just a set of backgrounds with poorly aligned blood pools. If an enemy dies in a set of diagonal stairs, the blood is still horizontal and just looks off. Resolution is low as well... It's not good. And it's unfortunate, since it had potential!The grayscale also affects perception a lot, often missing a zombie because it blended with the background. Of course, there's an option to color zombies (just get some green paint on top of it), but that ruins the aesthetic. So yeah, another problem not solved.Finally, I'd just like to say how awful the interface is. Jesus Christ, the level selection was infuriating. I can't even describe it. You basically have a sort of grid that doesn't fit on the whole screen, so you drag it to all sides. But it has acceleration, so it can sometimes get off the screen for no reason.Come on, use pages, ou a smaller grid... anything but this.Anyway.The game started out very nicely! I enjoyed the concept a lot, and chains were cool, at times.But the game dragged on for far too long, and the tight objectives didn't go well with how free the mechanics were.So yeah, interesting idea, poor execution.",

        "text": "10 Second Ninja is a really cool little platformer aimed for speedrunners! It's more of an initiation to speedrunning than a game tailored for experienced speedrunners, but it's probably enjoyable to both sides!Each level has a 10 second limit, taking some of Super Meat Boy's standards to the extreme, with quick restarts and keeping the player in the action at all times.I've 100% the game a bit after 4 hours, which includes beating the game in 4 minutes.The level themselves are pretty easy to beat, but getting the 3 stars (for time) can be infuriating! In a good way, though. Missing the mark for 0.02 seconds is tough, but finally getting the 3 stars is really rewarding as well!The boss fights were rather uninspired, but it's easy to overlook that.There are several worlds, each introducing a small mechanic and making use of it.It might be a bit price-y for its content, but the game itself is pretty good! The short length fits nicely, and it's a nice game to start up once in a while to make a quick <5 minutes speedrun. I like it.The humour in the game was a bit of a flop to me, but hey... the level design was nice and the game felt responsive most of the time.If you can get it cheap and the idea of speedrunning attracts you, give it a go! Some games can be overwhelming but 10 Second Ninja may just be the byte-sized introduction you're looking for.",

        "text": "LYNE is an interesting puzzle game, to me. It stands somewhere between Kami (a type of puzzles that I dislike -- not a game's fault, as the game is very well done!) and Hexcells ( a type of puzzles that I very much enjoy!).It's an abstact puzzle game very tightly connected with Graph Theory. Or, to put it simply, connecting dots.A big problem, for me, is the sheer amount of puzzles it has. 650. That's... waaay too much. The interesting levels and details get dilluted in this sea of very similar puzzles with no distinct patterns. I'd rather have 50 levels that followed a certain flow and had my think in different ways, rather than just grinding through a lot of them.All of the puzzles are computer-generated, although the 650 levels were hand-picked, mostly to fit the set's \"theme\" and difficulty.There are also daily sets, each with 25 puzzles (2 or 3 sets a day) that are not \"curated\", so to speak.The game has 26 sets. Each of these follows some rules of its own. There are no unique mechanics or anything of the sort. The rules consist mainly on \"size\" and \"number of colors\". That's fine, it is enough to make some interesting puzzles with some outside the box solutions.The game doesn't really have anything wrong, inherently. It's just too much, for me.And the later difficulty wasn't fun, to me. The size of these puzzles went beyond what I could easily process. Like Kami. The first levels set a pattern in your brain, easing you into it. (It was very weird that I started trying to connect everything, from words in books to coins on my desk haha!)That's all good, since the levels have enough information to be challenging, but not as much as to overwhelm you.The last few sets are a bit too crazy, with big boards and far ending points. There are too many entanglements for me to predict it in my head. And that leads to trial and error. And far longer time in each individual level. Every time I reached a solution I was just relieved. There was no rewarding feeling about it, so I decided to stop playing after 550+ levels. The daily sets are usually more enjoyable in this regard, although there are certainly some hard ones!These sets are generated by the date. Early week levels are easy. Mid-week are medium. Late-week are hard. Week-end are random.If you do enjoy casually solving puzzles, this game will certainly keep you busy for a while! I like shorter experiences. Something like 50-100 puzzles, but each with a very clear objective, and a certain progression between them.But hey, this is mostly preference. If you think you'd enjoy from the videos, give it a go! Presentation-wise, it's okay. Not particularly good, in my opinion. Visually, it's cool. It's simple and displays information clearly. (there are also unlockable palettes.)The music, however, I don't think was all that great. Maybe it's because I recently played Hexcells!I like the intention! The execution fell a bit short, though. It's a too \"on the background\". Each time you connect a dot, a sound is played, but things don't seem to flow very well.Regardless, this is a respectable puzzle game! It kept me playing for far longer than I expected, and it's certainly worth the money! :)",

        "text": "I had my eye on this game for a while, as I was making a similar game to Zotrix a while ago. The idea of a simple shoot 'em up with a more modular ship appealed to me, and I finally grabbed it.In a way, I had a lot of fun with it, as I was just looking for a mindless game. Shooting stuff is fun!Unfortunately, the pacing, progression and difficulty curve are all completely off. I don't know how the game was in Early Access for 4 months and these glaring issues haven't been dealt with...It's a basic modular shoot 'em up, with levels being composed of several preset waves. The waves are fairly well done, it was fun to play, for a while.The first problem happened right at the beginning. So, the game has several different space stations that you need to go to to complete quests and buy equipment. The paths have different levels of difficulty, which is good. However, the beginning of the game is really bad!Instead of introducing the shop and resource mechanics, you go for a 2-3 missions without being able to buy anything worthwhile. On the third mission, it's also incredibly hard to get to the end without buying anything. I restarted the game 3 or 4 times before I managed to buy the one! right item to beat the level. Where was the problem?In part, it was in how the game explains its upgrades. Items are divided into \"permanent\" and \"expendable\" upgrades. It seemed clear that expendable would be consumables, while permanent would be... well, permanent. That's not quite the case... Shields and Drones, for examples, are listed as expendable, but they actually carry over from mission to mission! The only \"expendable\" feature is that, for a given level, they can be destroyed and do not replenish until you finish that level. From their description, I assumed shields were just a consumable that would be activated for 20 seconds, or so. Turns out, they were actually all I needed to beat the mission.That's not all, though. The first, cheaper shields, are useless. They get destroyed by bullets too easily, rendering them useless. The higher level shields, on the other hand, are basically indestructible by bullets. The only way of destroying them, is by having ships ramming into you. Several in a row.Well, ok... just a minor misunderstanding.The bigger problem is: the higher level shields are really cheap! I bought the second highest on the third mission, and a couple of missions later I had the best. I was almost invincible. The only tough mission was the third. And that's because the game didn't communicate as it should have...Anyway, fast forward a bit, after a few mindless levels, I started looking at the resource trading and more expensive upgrades. In each level you gain some resources and credits. The resources you get are almost laughable, not really of any use. The credits are fine.The thing is, the economy is extremely basic. Assuming you're following the missions, you see what the next station is, and the game tells you which resources are higher. Then, you buy all the resources available to you, and sell on the next station. After a few levels, you have all the money you want.The game has 40 missions (each consisting of more than 2 levels, generally). Before the 15th mission, my ship was fully upgraded. I had virtually infinite money as resources. Only I had 25 missions left. At this point... what's the point?The story isn't particularly good, as the actual missions are simply \"Go from here, to here, to there\" because of a random excuse. There is no consequence or choice at all. It reminds me of a Clicker game, in some ways. Or an MMO, with the power creep thing. You just go around the places getting more powerful. The level don't keep up at all.I was steam rolling the game... With no purpose at all.The game has secondary weapons, like missiles or bombs. But you buy these individually. And if you use a missile, it's gone. Moreover, they're far, far weaker than your main weapon! It's useless. The drones are also a nice idea, but pointless is execution. They shoot automatically, but, again, they're very weak, and they also miss a lot.The levels are very basic too, as you leave exactly as you got in. There are \"upgrades\" in each level, as you start with a single shot, but can collect double and triple shot for that level. It's very linear, though, and you'll also get both upgrades at the same points. ...Oh well. There are other minor annoyances (and the music is simply there, tracks playing without a point) and some of the sound-effects overpowering everything else and being annoying.I was very negative in this review... Which doesn't really reflect my experience!I enjoyed the game a lot, as it was exactly what I was looking to play at the time. Something mindless and simple. It was cool!But the game itself, objectively speaking, has some very critical problems that make me not recommend it. I enjoyed my time, but I stopped playing after mission 18 because the game didn't keep up with the player. That's a huge  problem.If you think you'll enjoy it anyway, give it a go, the shooting can be fun! :)",

Although the main mechanic is using your laser to gain momentum and attack, it also adds different environmental mechanics, and sometimes switching the laser with something else (a bomb, a \"rubber-band\" like thing, etc.)The levels are well designed, with cool, completely different boss-fights.The audio-visual aspect didn't strike as all that impressive, but it serves the game well, being simple and clean.I don't have much more to say. The story is balls to the wall crazy. I have no clue about what exactly happened, but I like it!There are also some gimmicky levels that are pretty funny. Definitely recommend it.",

        "text": "Hexcells is a simple logic puzzle game. While it starts off very easy, it later on can get a bit more complicated, often taking me a while to \"see\" some clue I was missing.I've had this on my library for a long time, and only recently have I decided to play it, after Kami.This is more up my alley. The game can be very formulaic, perhaps, as there's never the need to \"guess\" any move. If you observe the board carefully, you'll have everything you need to make the next correct move. Initially, I didn't think it was that good, most levels being rather short and obvious. Thankfully, things got more complicated, levels bigger, and the game proved very satisfactory!It's very similar to minesweeper, although there's no losing. You won't touch a bomb and restart. Instead, you'll have +1 mistake, that later affects how many gems you get, for completionists' sake.The game also has various sets of puzzles, introducing a new mechanic between each one, keeping things interesting, without overwhelming the player with everything at once.Puzzle-wise, it's alright. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing mind blowing, in my opinion.What makes it stand out, for me, is the audio design. It's amazing! It's very minimalist, but it works really well!With most puzzle games, I just have my own music on... in the case o Hexcells, it felt rather out of place. There's an ambient track constantly playing in the background, but your actions in the game produce sound-effects in sync with the background track and create a great sense of \"atmosphere\", even in a puzzle game!It's something I rarely see in videogames that aren't music related. They tend to ignore how sound and music is important, so Hexcells is a breath of fresh air, to me!For that reason, above all else, I'll recommend this game. Looking at the developer's games, it seems indeed that sound always plays an important role, so I'll definitely be looking out for me! Elegant is a good word to describe it, I'd say.",

        "text": "As someone who dislikes many forms of puzzle games, I can't say that Kami is a game within my interests. Still, since it had a very unique aesthetic, I decided to give it a go.Visually, I've got nothing to add. The game is beautiful, and it also fits the general aesthetic. The music is also good, enhancing the aesthetic, but not much in terms of immersion or gameplay... to me, anyway. Still, it's cool!The puzzles are my problem. The first puzzles, I enjoyed! They were elegant, simple, and could still twist your brain a bit, when you found out that the most obvious solution wasn't the most efficient. I liked that. 4-6 moves was cool. The puzzles were also visually well put together! It's a gimmick, but it's well made nonetheless.The problem, for me, comes with later puzzles, where the patterns turn into chaos, and moves going as far as 19. Without hints, there are waaaay too many possibilities with very few seams where one could start. (I'm mentioning the last level) Thankfully, the hint system helps a lot! It's also limiting, since you have a daily limit for it... Roots from mobile, I guess. One hint per level, later on, is ideal, since at least you know where to start. All in all, it's just not my type of puzzle. There doesn't seem to be any real algorithm to solve it, and there barely are rules of approximation, later on. Initially, yes, sure. But later on, the levels are too chaotic for my taste. It's a matter of patience, at that point. The levels have 2 solutions. One, is perfect, with the given number of moves. The other one, is \"ok\", where you have ONE additional move. It's impressive how much of a difference that one move makes!Perhaps it proves how ingenous the game can be. It's just not for me. It's like sliding block puzzles. I hate those!The concept is simple, and it starts well! If it seems up your alley, go ahead! It's just not for me.The premium levels (free on this version!) were a cool gimmick, but the middle set, in particular, had very obnoxious patterns. They were so similar that it was almost impossible to identify anything in the puzzle. The other were conveyed properly, though.The solution is often awkward, not following any teaching of the game early on or anything. Good to pass the time, I guess.",

        "text": "This is one of the worst games I've recently played. On almost every level is does something very obviously wrong!I had my eye on Blaze Epic for a while, seeing that he released quite a lot of games following a similar vibe. I was interested, so I recently bought them all in a bundle. I started from the beginning: samurai_jazz.The concept is appealing to me. It reminds of older animes like Cowboy Bebop, marked the its jazz soundtrack and a very distinct \"samurai\" character. So yeah, I was eager to try it!Unfortunately, it is very, VERY primitive, and has some issues that just show how amateur the developer was -- and hurts the game a lot.I didn't finish the game. I pulled my way through the first 3 chapters, but quit at the 4th (out of five) out of principle. I'll get into it later.It follows many oldschool approaches: respawning enemies when you leave rooms, very basic controls, small levels/rooms, etc.The enemies also have distinct patterns of attack, and they're easily identifiable, which is good.The first thing that's awful is how the game controls. Dear God... Everything is so sticky!For example, when you collide with something, you can move. You need to stop pressing everything, and then move only in the opposite direction. You know, in a standard game, if you moved diagonally against a vertical wall, the character should still be able to slide up/down the wall, right? In a way, going around the obstacle. I hope the point is clear. In this game, you're just stuck. It's infuriating, and one of the most basic movement concepts one should learn...Then, there's the restart. When you die, you usually restart right at the top of the room. The problem is this -- you need to press a button to restart. Then, you need to press whatever button again to start moving. It's a big freakin' deal, since enemies are always very close to you. The game doesn't register is a button is pressed, only if it was pressed at that moment. It would be good, for example, if I pressed the right arrow to restart, and the character moved to the right when the game began. Nope. It's a big annoyance, believe me.As I mentioned, enemies start very close to you. They also 1 hit you. And they're also grouped in a very punishing manner, often makign death unavoidable until you managed to get them stuck. I don't want to go in detail into the combat. It is fairly cool, though. It's about having a stance to defend while you're standing still, and attacking when the time is right. Positioning is also important. But, since the controls are awful, I couldn't enjoy it at all.I didn't enjoy the music, and graphically, it isn't anything good either. It's bland and not polished at all.The story could be good, as the game goes for an interestingly cinematic style, especially in its framing. I like what it's trying to do. On the other hand, the whole game consists of getting \"bubble gum\" and \"cigarettes\" to random guys for them to let you pass. This, after you slaughter about 50 of them. But these, for some reason, you don't... Not welcome.Finally, the level design. This is was made me quit. Every level is just a big trap to keep you going. It's the whole \"time for money\" deal. The levels are designed in the worst way possible. You backtrack constantly, through room after room of respawnable enemies... And the combat is incredibly fragile, leading to immense frustrating.This isn't all, though. The game has some sections reliant on you getting through spike that go up and down. The player has to find the safe place to stand. Cool. Except -- oh, wait, there are invisible traps! Restart...Wait, wait, one final thing. This is where I quite, this is good. There's a room full of enemies, with 3 switches. After you kill all of the enemies (after several restarts), you press a switch. Oops, spikes come from below you, dead! Restart the room full of enemies. What happened? Oh, yeah, you need to choose the correct switch not to die. They're all identical, so good luck.It's pure trial and error in the worst way possible. I didn't find it fun in any way. So there you go. This is one of the most frustrated reviews I've written, I hope it reflects what kind of game it is. Hopefully, his other games are better than this! I'm not that eager anymore, though...",

        "text": "Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space is a hard game for me to come to terms with. It has a lot that I love and a lot that I absolutely hate, but no one can really say it's a \"bad game\". Most of what's wrong with it is wrong at the very core of it, and is only wrong considering what people expect from it.It's a pure adventure game, like the older point n' clicks with some very wild solutions to puzzles. It does have some other problems, mostly related to how it conveys important information, but those problems would be minor in any other genre.The game has several levels, each being a more of less self contained puzzle. But the puzzles don't follow a pattern or a type. They're completely different from one another, which can be very... alienating (pun intended).There was a level where you had to (SPOILERS!) melt wax into a padlock to see its pattern, and figure out the number code to open it.That's stretching waaaay too far out of what the player expects. I'd also like to mention that it doesn't seem to be an actual method of \"breaking\" locks -- at leat a quick Google search didn't find anything.There are other puzzles with some quite clever solutions, as they're all very physical, in a sense. It's the kind of improvised solutions that a human being might try, if he were actually there.Unfortunately, this is a video-game, where things don't quite work as well as one would expect, and it's very, very easy to miss crucial aspects of a given puzzle.There are guides for that, if you want. I'd recommend, if you're in the game to experience its setting.Which is what I love. It's pure old sci-fi. The kind of suspenseful from movies, with a very characteristic soundtrack to go along with it. It's awesome!I really love what it's trying to do, clearly being a game that stands on its own. It's not dictacted by fun or what players want, it's clearly a very personal project, and I commend it for it!If that's what you're looking for, definitely give it a go!There are some other problems, especially with the brightness levels not being very clear. That game doesn't have a gauge (something like \"increase brightness until you can barely see the darkest image\"), so I didn't want to push it too high. As a result, there were some items that were completely obscured, at some points. Not ideal.Another big problem is the camera. First Person puzzle game tend to give me A LOT of motion sickness. This is no exception. At times it was physically painful. The camera is very wanky, contantly moving a lot to the sides. It's especially annoying in the shooting sections.One last thing is how the interface is rather clunky, but bearable.As a conclusion -- it's not perfect. Not even close. It has some very frustrating moments, mostly because the player didn't get the right information, or, in a particular level, the controls were incredibly dodgy. But, if you can withstand it, there's an incredibly unique game in this, with a nice twist at the end.If you're a fan of old sci-fi, I recommend it!",

        "text": "Clandestinity of Elsie was a big letdown, looking at all of the other reviews. They're rather suspicious, I'd say, mostly claiming that same thing. \"It's very much like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, true survival horror game!\"... It's a really standard game, to me. It had very little going for it.I have not played those old-school horror games (nor am I that big into horror games in general), but the only similarity I've found is how clunky the controls are. Sure, it creates some tension when you know you have to face enemies, but it's not nearly enough to support the previous claims.This is an RPGMaker game, and it looks like one. There's almost nothing to make it stand-out in the regard. However, there are 2 aspects that are above average RPGMaker game. First, it's the lighting system, with actual shadow casting that does a fairly good job in maintaining the atmosphere. Then, there's the resolution fitting my screen, instead of the game misreading my desired aspect ratio and screwing fullscreen up.These 2 aspects, however, are present, but not particularly stellar. The resolution is a pure upscale, which doesn't look very good. The lighting system is also very primitive and rough. I think it's a script \"outside\" of their control, but still...It's 4 directional, which isn't good. Making it mouse controlled would make it actually useful to look around corners and such. But no, it's just a light directly in front of you.Anyway, my biggest problems is this: the game does nothing new, and the remotely interesting parts of the game are completely outside of the player's control. The game is very transparent as to its story and meaning even before the end, so I'll not be spoiling much (do not worry, I won't spoil the ending). You're a person with mental problems and an alcoholic. That's rather overdone, but hey, no problem. What is a problem is that it goes nowhere with it.The alcoholism, for example, is a trigger for allucinations. You drink only once or twice in the game, and it's completely scripted. \"You will drink because I'm making you drink\" is what the game says. Just because we need to keep things moving.You don't even press a button to drink, it's like a cuscene. As a counter-example, I'll mention the game Spate. That game was a 2D platformer about an alcoholic father as well. The difference is that drinking actually changed things and was completely in the player's control. It would twist the environment, but also make the player faster and jump higher. It was a tradeoff. It wasn't needed to complete the game, but it helped. It made you feel more powerful, but certainly wasn't a necessity. That was a good usage.This game has none of that.Then, there's the fact that, as I said, there's a very distinct barrier between the game and the story. When you play, you're not playing the story. You're just walking through the environment, with the occasional monster appearing.Everything that's relevant to the story is told through cutscenes. Everything.The gameplay is just \"\"\"exploring\"\"\" every room to find ammo and health packs, killing every monster until the next bit of story. Find key, open door, keep going, rinse and repeat. None of your actions has any impact or influence in the game.The comparison with Lone Survivor has been made by a reviewer. I'll have to disagree 100%, as Lone Survivor had very interesting mechanics that affected what happened in the game world. The pills, for example. Even the shooting had significance. Every action had some meaning in that game. In this game, it's mostly filler.The game also lacks in the \"game\" department. Ammo is found everywhere. Basically right before/after a monster, you'll find ammo, making the system pointless. Might as well give me a gun with infinite ammo.The stealth aspect of the game (trying to go unnoticed) isn't the best, as it's not very clear when you can be detected or not. The shooting is slow, making it very unlikely that you can escape without getting hit most of the time. Most of the enemies are completely undetectable until it's too late as well! They're near you, in the dark, without any sound. Until they run at you, that is. That's not a good way of doing things, in my opinion.What else? Well, the environments have little to no thought put into them. They're just filler. Most of the building have windows with 3 bullet holes in them, just because. The place is filled with trash, mattresses and blood, without any environmental story telling or clues of any sort. Most of the rooms are just furniture thrown together with no sense of characterizations of any sort (aside from \"this generic person tried to kill himself - that's it\").I'm sorry, I realize that I sound very bitter. I didn't hate the game that much, but I just found nothing new or interesting in here. And it isn't a greatly executed game either. It's just a generic RPGMaker game... being sold.Hopefully, this review brings another perspective to potential players. If you still want to try the game, go ahead! Maybe there's something in there that just didn't click with me. I just think that it adds nothing to the genre at all.Try Lone Survival, Knock-knock and Home if you're looking for something more interesting.",

        "text": "Crimsonland is a top-down arena shooter. That's about it. I mean, really. Things come from all sides and you shoot them.And it feels pretty damn satisfying! I've got to say, this is a game that I'm in 2 minds about. On one hand, it has a pretty bad design, in the places where it counts. On the other hand, it's glorious to paint the field red with the blood of your enemies!The game has a ton of different weapons, which is great on survival mode! On the survival modes, you also have a ton of perks that alter your play a bit, almost like modern rogue-lites. The game has no bosses, no maps, no levels, nor anything else of that sort. It does have quite a bit of enemy variety, although the differences between the types are very subtle.The game also has a \"campaign\" of sorts, with different levels. The campaign is dreadful. If you read the reviews, you can see most people calling the game out as \"randomness instead of skill\", and it's absolutely true. On these levels, you have to rely on the \"right\" weapon dropping for you to beat a level. Sometimes that being insufficient, requiring additional power-ups at the right moments. Beating it on \"Normal\" is fine, but on Hardcore, there's one particular level that requires astronomical luck. It's called Spideroids and it's dreadful. It features these Spider enemies that work as follows: big, slow spider -> kill it, you get 2 smaller, but faster spider -> kill it, get another 2, smaller and faster -> this happens like 8 times or something ridiculous like that. Your character doesn't run faster than the small spiders, and to add insult to injury, they actually gain speed overtime, so you'll be overrun after a while.Unless you get a very specific set of drops, it's impossible to win.The AI in this game is both great and bad. It's more intelligent than to run directly at you. On Spideroids, though, it makes things impossible. I'm not even sure if the game was actually playtested (as in, without cheats -- without choosing weapons and powerups at will, making sure that it is possible, regardless of the chance of those conditions happening)... Some enemies run at you, while others observe where you're going, and they adjust their direction to meet you at that point. Each type of enemy also has different characteristic that are quite interesting! For example, zombies are slower and then to flock, while spiders are quick and unpredictable. That sort of thing. They all try to get to you in a swarm, but they have different details that are very much appreciated!Overall, the campaign is very situational. Fortunately, where the game shines is one its Survival Modes. There are 4 or 5 different ones that you can choose from. The game and your character are rather slow, which is boring. There is one mode, though, called Blitz, where things are a bit faster, and it's freakin' awesome! I really enjoyed that mode. The sound design is solid, but the music was very uninsteresting to me. The weapons' sounds are very distinct from one another, but I feel that they lack a bit of power, in general. Nothing too important, as the game still feels great to play!There isn't much to say at all, here. It's a very old-school type of game. It's like the analog of Painkiller and Hard Reset in 2D. While 3D shooters have the great advantage of a fully fleshed physics and first person perspective to make things visceral (God, bolt weapons in Bioshock felt so good!), Crimsonland swarm you with enemies from all sides, each hit splashing blood on the floor and leaving bodyparts behind. Ones that don't actually vanish! There's something fantastic about these mindless games that really appeal to me! And if this sounds like your cup of tea, go for it! As I said, the campaign isn't very good (beat it once to unlock all of the weapons and perks), but the core game is great! Oh, also... I've never played the original game, so I can't compare it to that.",

        "text": "This is a very hesitant recommendation. Steam Marines is a turn-based roguelike that tries to stand out by having the player control a squad of 4 characters (of different classes), instead of a single one.It's also extremely difficult -- far too much so, to the point of imbalance.I haven't played many turn based games, so my perception of the difficulty might be distorted. However, I will say that the gap between Easy and Normal mode is huge -- especially considering that there are also Hard and Brutal difficulties. The game is pretty standard in its mechanics -- each character has action points that they use to move and attack, there's ammo and reloading, and position is crucial. The enemies follow the same rules, some with little quirks that make the game more interesting.It's... solid. I enjoyed my Easy playthrough... somewhat. I'll get into it later.The game has several issues that make it just an \"okay\" game, for me. Still, okay is fine, in this case. I do think the mechanics work well together, and a full playthrough is enjoyable. But that's about as far as I go, as someone who quit on Normal Mode.It's hard to review exactly how I see the imbalance in the game, since it's heavy on numbers. Let's just say that enemies on Easy kill you in perhaps 2 hits, and only have 2 Action points per turn. They also have 6 HP. On Normal mode, they have 4 Action points, 12 HP and kill you in 1 hit. The actions points, especially, make a huge difference, as you need to be really far away from them to be safe. Plus the necessary reloading (that takes ALL of your action points), small rooms, and several enemies at once, make Normal mode infuriating. It's too easy to lose a character on the very first level. And there are 30 or 35 of them!On Easy Mode, however, it's still hard to get through the first set of levels. When you reach the 6th level (second area), you have access to these Hulk suits that are incredibly overpowered, in comparison with the normal characters. After that, you can play through the game rather easily. Which is a huge problem, for me. The first set of levels being by far, the hardest. It's just a big wall that keeps most players away.On my easy playthrough, I actually quit out of boredom. I understood the mechanics and quirks of the enemies, so the game got pretty formulaic. When you beat the game, you go into NG+. I beat that as well. When I started NG+2 I quit. It was simply not fun, anymore. I knew what I need to do everytime, it wasn't fun.At that point, I tried Normal. I didn't get past the first set of levels... again. I could do it, but not without losing a character. There's an incredibly big difference between the two difficulties. It's just not fun, for me.Then, there are other issues about its \"rogue-like\" label. It's always the same thing, essentially.Character have 4 levels, with each one having a choice between 2 skills - a passive, and an active one. Always the same 2 for the given level and class. There's virtually no point in experimentation.Some of the classes are also virtually useless, so your party won't vary too much.Then, the worst of it, is that there are almost no equipment and weapons to find. Even when you do, it's purely numerical and provide absolutely no interesting choices. It's just a question of \"this does more or less damage, accuracy, etc. etc.\". If you take something like The Binding of Isaac, there are tons of interactions between the items, some of them drastically changing the game. In Steam Marines, there's none of that.It also lacks a purpose, having a very monotonous pacing. There are 5 or 6 \"zones\", each with 5 levels. You find an elevator to proceed to the next level. Every 5th level, there's a Boss in the elevator. It's always the same. Story is virtually non-existant, and the Bosses aren't very interesting, either. Take FTL, for example, and there's a very clear threat and purpose in the Mothership fight. The whole game is a build-up to that moment. In this game, there's nothing resembling that. Especially with NG+, you can just keep going, without any sense of progress.It's also far too long for each run. Even on Easy mode, is may have taken me 6 hours or something. This is apparently a very, very negative review, despite the recommendation. Well, I really had big issues, especially being unable to progress on Normal mode. Maybe it's just not for me. But I still recognize some merit to its mechanics are the general idea. Perhaps it can appeal to veterans of Turn-Based games. For me, it seems imbalanced, lacking a good difficulty curve as well as pacing a variation.",

        "text": "Magnetic By Nature isn't a terrible game; on the contrary, it's a somewhat fresh and original platformer! Unfortunately, the pacing and level design, coupled with some bugs and horrible interface made the game boring to me. It was simply not fun, and that's the only reason I'm not recommending.Again, it's not bad, and you may very well get some enjoyment out of it, if you enjoy platformers! It's rather easy, with most levels being completed in less than 3 restarts, a couple of more difficult ones not passing 15. And I'm not that good at platformers.I'll just briefly explain each aspect I did (or not) enjoy. The gameplay revolves around magnets, as the name suggests. You can be attracted or repeled (and attract and repel some objects). It's unique, as far as I know, and it did provide some interesting sections.The level design, however, lacks a lot of pacing and progression. It seems like just a bunch of random level thrown together. The first two worlds introduced mechanics; that last 3 didn't.If you look at Super Meat Boy, there's clearly a lot of thought into teaching the player how to overcome certain obstacles that are recurring in later level, in a harder form. In this game, levels are very, very gimmicky. It's about a quirky feature of the physics system that helps you complete the level, but not really a challenge. And all of the levels are like that, for the most part. There isn't an obstacle that you have to learn, really. It's just... a bunch of levels. And for me, that wasn't fun at all, it just felt like a drag.The controls are a bit floaty, which I didn't like very much.Then, there's how levels work: there's a collectible in every level. Some are really easy to get and go well with the level. Others are just completely out of the way. Meh, it can provide a bit more challenge, but I don't feel like it added a whole lot.The bugs include getting stuck (in mid air, for some reason), leaderboards not seeming to work, levels completed not tracking properly, sometimes, etc.The getting stuck one was particularly annoying, as it happened several times, for no reason.The game encourages speedruns, looking at the achievements. That would be really cool! ... If the leaderboards worked. I've never been able to see how other players did in their levels. Which kind of defeats the point. The game wasn't very interesting for me to speedrun it either.What I mean by horrible interface is how cluttered it is when explaining very simple controls, and how unresponsive and inflexible the menus are. For example, there's no level selection. What you can do is go to the Hub (always resetting your position to your starting point) lose some seconds (or minute) traversing to the world you want, and then select a level. But, if you're in a level already, you NEED to go abck to the Hub to select another one. And it's a waste of time! When you finish a level, you only have two options: restart, or go to the next level. Nothing else. There are other problems I could mention, but it's not worth it.Again, even though my review was very negative, it's not a terrible game. Read other reviews: people seem to like, and that's cool! I'm just writing about my experience with it. Some of the levels were fun, but most were completely forgettable and not challenging. The other individual aspects are great! The artstyle (although I have some reservations) was pretty good, the soundtrack was very good as well, and used properly, keeping you in the flow of the game.I just didn't have any fun, by end.",

        "text": "I've played the first episode of this game more than a year ago, and I was very excited to play the rest! Seeing how the game was being funded by each episode, I decided to wait until it was \"finished\".When it released on Steam, for 10$, I assumed it was. After getting the game... I realized it's not finished at all. There are 4 episodes, and yet no closure. Each episode ends in a sort of \"cliff hanger\", and the last one follows the same principle. So, know that you are paying for only a part of the whole story.Now, there's also the fact that this is purely a homage to Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft (and other similar writers, I assume). It's far more Poe than Lovecraft in both atmosphere and scenes. It's not the scientific exploration of grander-than-life terrors and beings of ultimate power, but more about the schizophrenic perception of the world, one that is full of ravens.The atmosphere in the game is really well achieved! And there are scenes that felt genuinely creepy and unsettling to me, which is awesome! The game, despite its very low resolution, looks good, and, for the most part, gives the player enough information. The soundtrack is my favourite part of the game, it definitely fits the theme and is very pleasant to hear....Unfortunately, that's about it. As a game, it's a very average point n' click, with some obtuse puzzles, although it manages to be reasonable, most of the time. There are some frustrating sections, though.There's no player agency. The game doesn't really feel like it wants to express something, or tell a story. It just keeps going, with each episode being very disconnected from the previous, instead of building up to something.It borrows from the mentioned authors, but that's all it does. The story revolves around the occult, but not in any meaningful way. I just felt nothing, playing through it. And, for a point n' click, it's a hard sell, to me. In a genre that relies mostly on story, it as very little going for it.I'll leave it as recommended for the single fact that its individual aspects are very well done, and the overall game is also nicely executed! It just feels rather soul-less. It borrows in atmosphere, but lacks any kind of meaning or expression, in my opinion. ...I'm rather disappointed. Especially considering how much I loved the first episode. Then again, this feels like a product. It sells, so it keeps going. I'm not saying the developers have no love/care with what they're doing, since this clearly came from a good place. It just lost direction as the episodes kept going. Looking at them individually, they're good! But as a whole, they don't really fit.Poe and Lovecraft are mostly known for their short stories, and I feel there's a reason for that. Each story approached a different subject, or a similar subject in a different way. And, in that short moment captured, it made sense! This game is just a string of different ideas thrown together. The game aspect also adds nothing to the experience (aside from using a pixelated artstyle). There's nothing that you, as the player, have to do to that you really need to think about. The puzzles are merely there to extend the whole thing, serving very little purpose, overall.... I don't know, I'm just rambling, at this point.I want to like it, and I do live each aspect of it. But it just feels meaningless. I finished the game without feeling like I experienced much at all.",

        "text": "Cargo Commander is a very interesting game, to me. It has some more serious aspects in its setting and story, but it covers it all up with tongue-in-cheek humour. It also has a very slow and game-y progression system, seemingly in place to justify the 10\u20ac price tag.If you look at the top reviews (both positive and negative), you'll see that the negative ones have considerably more playtime than the positives. There's a reason for that. The game gets very monotonous, completely desynchronized with its progressions pacing. It's one of those games that uses procedural generation and rare items to collect to extend its playtime in a ridiculous way. Reprisal Universe is a game that did something similar: the content is so sparse that the game loses a lot as a result.Anyway, this review will not be of much use to most people. If you want to know if the game is mechanically good, or whatever, you can check all the other reviews. I mostly agree.I liked the game, the execution is well done! Aside from the progression, anyway. The game has some little tricks that you have to learn, and it's a nice thing to pass time with. For a while.What is this review about, then? It's about how the game explores the darker themes.In this game, you're stranded in space. You accepted a job of collecting cargo from containers lost deep in space. You're away from you family, with them not knowing what your job actually is. To top that, you're also victim of a big corporation, who has little to no regard of its employees, and uses a gamification system to keep them working, ranking up and give the illusion of progress. All that while doing the very menial work of collecting cargo.There's a lot to think, with this premise. The game takes a humorous approach to it, though, which, in my opinion, leaves a big part of the game unexplored. It's a very mechanically oriented game: you're constantly trying to achieve something in the game, which doesn't leave much space for thought.How does the game explore its themes, though? Well, there are mainly 2 aspects that I noticed. First, is how you encounter other cargo commanders -- players -- dead in some containers. You loot them for ammo, caps (upgrade currency), and the like.The enemies also seem like mutated players. Confirming that you're not the only one out in deep space, and also that the company simply abandons its employees after death. The other aspect is the mailing system. Every so often, you'll receive emails. Some are tutorials for a newly introduced system, some are from your family, and others are from the company, congratulating you on ranking up. Apparently, you'll also receive an e-mail from a lost employee asking for help -- but this one is very deep into the game, and I didn't get to that. Which goes to show how sparse the content is...The most interesting aspect of these e-mails are SPOILERS how, eventually, the companies emailing system malfunctions, revealing the automated responses. They have <insert random compliment for - Obedience> instead of \"we appreciate your loyalty\" and things like that. When that happened, it gave me a very portal-esque feeling. Of how the company may have even ended, and there you were, still in space, now without any hope of every returning to your family... It can be a really dark game, at times. And that's awesome!While I do really like these aspects of the game, I don't think it takes a big advantage of them. For once, as I've mentioned several times already, the content is veeery sparse. Most players will probably not even get to that point, for the simple reason that the game doesn't really evolve much. It's interesting and new during the first couple of hours (perhaps a bit longer), but then it gets really stale. And getting an email every couple of hours really isn't enough to keep the interest high -- especially since the actual game, while random, gets a bit too formulaic.Then, there's the fact that these aspects are very disconnected from the action. It's a side thing, and players will treat as that. It's too game-y for it not to be like that, I guess.Also, the fact that death is meaningless, kind of defeats the whole point, although this is a very feeble subject, for the time. I've seen a game called The Flock a few days ago -- apparently, it's a multiplayer game with actual perma-death. If you die, you can't play anymore. If everyone dies, the game closes. It seems like a bigger game, so I people were very skeptical of paying for it. I'm assuming the skepticism would translate to small indie games as well. It's also a horror game, so that choice ends up influencing the game in a different manner... ANYWAY, I'm rambling.I'd like to see actual permadeath in some games. That would certainly make the player far more conscious of his choices, and hopefully enhance the experience, overall. In this game, it doesn't happen, although it would have been a cool approach. Then again, not at all marketeable, so I understand why the game is like this.Yeah, this was not a review at all. It was me rambling about some aspects that aren't even about the main game. On the positive side, I think I highlighted something that other reviews mostly fail to mention, so yeah.P.S.: I was experimenting with this idea of perma-death and multiplayer used as a \"history\"/mark, instead of competitive/cooperational play -- you know, finding dead players, sharing tips -- or traps -- like in Dark Souls... If you're reading this, I'd like to know you opinion about it. Permadeath is risky, but I'd say it's worth it, if the game is explained accordingly -- and priced, I guess. ",

        "text": "Sang-froid is a great game, in concept! The translation of the idea into a videogame is also done well, mechanics-wise. The big problem, for me, is how unpolished and frustrating the execution has been, especially for a 15\u20ac game.The game feels dated in almost every respect. Graphics, story-telling, how the combat and guns work, transitions, item system, etc. etc. Everything is very imperfect and takes way more time than it should.I don't want to make a full blown review, so I'll try to very briefly state the most glaring problems.I've played the game twice. Once on Easy Mode, once on Hard Mode. Easy Mode was very uninteresting. Combat over strategy. Hard Mode was infuriating, since, while strategy was the focus, the combat was still very much required to a great degree, while your character was clearly very underpowered. As a result, almost every mission required multiple tries, even after I had the strategy laid and should have worked. I completely ignored the story and all of the other aspects aside from mechanics in the second playthrough.Why? Because it's terrible. Honestly. The story is fairly cool, especially since I do like fairy-tale and folk stories, in general. The problem is how the story is delivered. It's... mind boggling to me. The story is told exclusively through \"cutscenes\" that are merely characters talking to one another. Nothing fancy. The problems are: the writing isn't good, coupled with horrible voice-acting. I don't think the actors were in the same room at all. Each line feels completely disconnected from the situation at hand, and the tone is completely off. It just doesn't deliver.Then, there's the fact that, visually, they use some pretty bad 3D models, just because. The animations aren't all that great either. Nothing justifies the choice for these \"cutscenes\". A simple 2D conversation, with little animation and no voice-acting could have been much more polished without half of the work. Not to mention that this had nothing to do with the game. Yet, it's one of the main elements of the product, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.It's really, really, bad. I don't understand this choice at all. I could understand a sub-par execution, if it was a new idea, or something. This brings nothing new, nothing impressive. On the contrary, it's glaringly bad...The game itself, for those of you not aware, is like Orcs Must Die, although the tower and combat phases are completely separated. First, you place the traps you can. Then, you fight each wave successively, with combat. That's fine, although it can be kind of annoying when you don't know exactly what will come at you (they tell you which enemies and where, but there are nuances...) and you have no chance to fix mistakes without restarting.You'll get a plethora of different traps that you can later upgrade, but some of them are mostly useless or situational.Still, they fit the setting, and some combinations were fun to use.You can also buy potions and weapons in the town. Potions are useless, except from the health ones. The others are burnt money, unless you're on the last missions. Why? Because you barely get any money to upgrade. So, why waste it on consumables? You gain so little money that you'll take until the last few missions to be able to get a decent combination of weapons. Espcially on hard mode.Far too long.The upgrade system is cool, although you can completely lock yourself if you use your points in the wrong place. You can \"undo\", but only when you choose where to put them. If you \"confirm\",you're stuck with them.Ok, what's next?Graphically, it's a PS2 era game. If that. You can't see 7 meters in front of you, and I'm not sure if it's a design decision, or a performance choice. Then, the game suffers from fps problems when there are too many enemies active. And I have a 3.4Gz quad-core. There's no justification that I can think of, really.The combat is extremely clunky. That could be fine, since you're not supposed to use it a lot. Except... that you need to, since traps are very limited. So except lots of restarts. The game has a lock-on system that will often change targets when you least want to. There are some enemies that will go underground to heal when they're low on HP. So, you want to kill them asap.  The problem is: when there are several characters, the game may very well choose to target someone else. Well, crap...The gun suffers a similar problem with the auto-aim. It \"snaps\" to the closest target... sometimes. Sometimes it also seems to lag, and suddenly aims completely off, leading to a failed shot. You also take a loooong time to reload, which is cool. Bullets are also fairly expensive, so the point is to hold on to them. Which is infuriating when the game throws your aim off!Here's another thing: the game rewards you for using less traps. You can use Actions Points to cut trees, instead of placing traps. This further encourages combat, rather than strategy. Encourages the clunkiest system... And unbalances the game has a result, a bit. On Hard Mode, where you want to maximize traps, you end up getting way less money, making it even harder to upgrade, thus making the future missions even harder.There's a bit of a snowball effect, here... and not a good one.Then, there are various other problems. The interface is big and full of boxes, and still manages to miss several very important aspects... You take far too long to navigate from the stores to the village and your home. It's the clicking, but there are way too many. There's also a lot of information missing, leading to even more time wasted...There's no plain restart button that starts you exactly at the level you were in. You always have to go to the strategy screen, and then click like 3 or 4 times to confirm textboxes before you go into the level. It doesn't help that there's always a load screen between transitions. So, except 2 loading screens every time you make a mistake and want to restart. Or simply die...I realize this review is a bit toxic. I apologize for that. The game isn't terrible. The game itself, if I ignore everything else, can be fun and challenging, at times. The problem is that the game has way too many issues in too many different places, and it results in a very frustrating experience, overall.It tries to do a lot more than the game itself, but it doesn't know how. Seems like a lot of wasted work. I just can't understand the people claiming it to be a \"masterpiece\". In concept, it's great. Execution... not really. Orcs Must Die is a far more enjoyable game (both of them, in my opinion) and they provide more content than this, for a lower or equal price. And undoubtedly more finely tuned and polished.",

        "text": "Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a stellar take on the Metroidvania game. It's really good, although \"typical\" metroidvania, but it certainly does an impressive job on variety and how satisfying the combat system and enemy AI is to fight.I beat it on Hard Mode, although I'd recommend Normal for a first playthrough. The main reason being the Boss fights -- almost impossible to beat them on your first try, as each one has a very unique gimmick and weaknesses that you need to learn before actually having a good fight. Aside from challenging combat, the game has lots of nuances regarding the equipment and towns you visit, that can be really confusing and frustrating for newcomers. The game is not gentle at all. It doesn't explain its more complex mechanics and story consequences very well, which may result in entire cities simply disappearing when you least expect. I was, for example, planning on buying a certain set of armor and items from a city... but when I got back, everyone was dead. And I had absolutely no clue why.On another occasion, I need a Bossfight item... but one that I couldn't get, because I didn't kill certain Bosses in a certain order...It has some interesting design choices like these. These aren't necessarily bad, but they certianly come as a shock and feeling of unfairness when you first encounter them. The game is designed for multiple playthrough, trying out different builds and characters. It's impossible to see everything in a single run. And that's fine! The game just doesn't make that very clear, in my opinion.Another interesting choice is how the game rewards higher rankings on Boss fights. Both with XP and certain Stat upgrades -- higher rank=higher stats. In a way, it's good to reward good players, sure! On the other hand, it makes the balance snowball in favor of high-level players. If the game is balanced for high-level skill, with high-level stats, people who haven't learned the mechanics as well get even poorer, since they get less stat upgrades. It's a weird choice.My reasoning for this is that the game is balanced in according to ranks, in a way. The reward for good rankings mostly helps to get high ranking on the next Bosses, and doesn't necessarily play such an impact on the general game's balance.Either way, it's a weird principle to have, and one that generated quite a bit of discussion on the forums. Once again, as a new player, I certianly felt like it was unfair! Especially since Bosses weren't repeatable -- if you've had a low rank, it's low forever. It's a good system for multiple playthroughs -- now you know better, practice more!In traditional metroivania style, you have several different areas, locked by different keys and powerups. There are also tons of optional Bosses with item rewards that let you craft weapons, armor, etc. It has a great amount of nuance and I'm probably going to explore it more in the future.The game is really challenging, but I'd say it's definitely worth it. Lots of hidden items and areas to investigate. Really awesome soundtrack! And it looks really good as well.The combat system hinges a lot on skill canceling, and comboing which feels satisfying to learn. The biggest problem I have with it is how it tries to make some skills a hybrid of progress gating (platforming) and combat.Some of the spells you gain are crucial to you traversing the game's areas and unlock new ones. They're also usable in combat. Unfortunately, with a controller, you can only have one of each type active. And the useful ones for platforming and absolutely worthless in combat... making the constant switching a pain in the butt. It's annoying, but not game breaking.The platforming is also a bit counter-intuitive, at times, but the sections are well designed, once you learn the systems well. All in all, this game reminded me of how much I love metroivania games, and how lost I become in these worlds, playing for hours at a time without noticing. It's an impressive effort from just a couple of people. Great job!",

        "text": "Pongo is a really nice idea, but very bladly executed. It's simply bad in too many ways. Level design is almost non-existant, the art-style actively goes against the gameplay, the combat is not only unnecessary, but also badly designed, and even the physics' system is artificial in a way that, again, hinders gameplay.I'll explain what I like about it first, and then go quickly over all of the negatives mentioned.I really like this idea! I've original, and it could have led to some really interesting platforming sections! And I don't dislike the way it was implemented: as in, you have 3 Modes: a shooting mode, where you can't use the pogo to jump; a normal mode, where you charge the jump and then jump, and a true pogo mode, where you automatically jump when you hit the ground. It's a bit clunky, especially with the transitions between them, but over all, it's pretty cool.A really annoying thing was how there's absolutely no difference between the pogo and the true pogo mode, visually... They look and sound exactly the same. This means that you may expect to be in a certain mode, but realize that you're not, dying as a result... There should definitely be some feedback...That's about it, really. Why do I say the level design is non-existent? Well, there are 50 or so levels. BUT, only 2 are memorable. And they're memorable for their gimmicky way. It could have been a very nicely used gimmick, but no. The developers were simply like: \"Hey, look at this cool level design!\", but the levels provide absolutely no challenge, and remain an idea in a vacuum...The game is only mildly fun when you try to \"\"\"speedrun\"\"\" it. And I'm intentionally using those many quotation marks. Speedrunning, which seemed the perfect direction for the game, only works as in: run without stopping to kill anything, and pray that the level is timed accordingly. Some levels are. Others aren't. There are moving platforms that take up to 20 seconds to complete their cycle. It's really fun to wait for them.Then, there's the fact that there is almost no variation. Sometimes a new obstacle appears, but they're not used intelligently or anything. They're just there.There's also the mind-boggling fact that they levels sometimes have these \"sidepaths\" or new islands to the side. These serve absolutely no purpose. None. At all. They're just there. Is it to trick the player? Some even have power-ups, that vanish within 10 seconds, making them worthless. I don't understand. There are no collectibles in the game, no story, nothing... Why are these even there? Then, there are some challenging jumps. These are really annoying. Why? Well, the levels are arranged in hexagons, for some reason. Meaning that you'll having to aim for the outer points of the hexagonal platforms. And jump out of them as well. You'll also have to time it perfectly, otherwise you'll miss and fall to your death. The other problems are dependent on other systems. The graphic style, for example. It's cute. It looks like a pretty nice, low cost way of creating a game. But not of this type! There's zero perspective on depth. The colors have no shades or anything for one to gauge where the platforms are. So, half of the time, you'll time jumps inappropriately, because you couldn't see how far the platform was.To make matters worse, the moving platforms are timed never to top. And they change direction at the absolutely farthest point that you can still jump on them. (An awkward way of phrasing it, sorry!) It's possible to jump on those platforms, but it's precision for the sake of it. There are a few levels like this, those being very frustrating. It's not interesting design is any way. It also pairs very badly with the levels' length. They usually take 50 seconds (short-ish ones), with some taking up to 2 minutes. 90% of the hard levels aren't hard. They're mostly running forward, or doing a couple of short, easy jumps. Until you reach the hard jump. They're a time waster. And they'll extend the gametime by a lot...What's wrong about the combat? Lack of feedback. The lives are on the corner, not standing out. But that's not the big problem. What is? The fact that there's no visual indication of when you hit. And even the sound doesn't play properly. It's barely noticeable!Then, the enemies' attack animations are in no way connected with you taking damage... you take damage at an arbitrary time, even without playing the animation... it's pointless.But hey, you can simply evade all of the combat without a worry. They're too slow to pursue you, and so are bullets. It's really a completely pointless \"feature\". It makes the game slower without any benefit.Finally, the physics. On a basic level, they're solid. The game is a bit too slow, but other than that, it's satisfying to jump and run, when you nail it. The problem comes with the moving platforms. The developers had no concept of momentum. So, if you jump out of a moving platform, it will be as if the platform wasn't moving. That's really weird. It feels very, very wrong, and will totally destroy your timing.Even worse, is how artificial they've made the player stay still in a moving platform, since momentum is non-existant. I'm pretty sure it's a simply check of \"if the player is exactly on the platform, his base speed in the same as the platform\". Why am I sure? Because the game has some environmental pieces: small rocks, and destroyable nubs. These would serve very little purpose, being there just to provide some variety. However, if you step on a rock in a moving platform, you will NOT move with the platform. The platform will move without you, and then you'll most likely fall. See where the momentum would have played a very important role? These things happen a lot. And they just make the game feel incomplete and amateur. And still being sold for 10$... It's irritates me, honestly.In a physics based game, at least study physics a bit more... especially when it negatively affects your game.The interface is generally bad as well, not giving you good information when you need it, and so on. I won't dwell on that, since it's not too important.Overall, the game had some potential. But the fact that the level design is so uninspired, and even \"broken\" in some sections make the game really bad. It's unfortunate. 50 levels that are mostly filler do not, in any way, justify the price. And it's a real shame, since I really like the idea.I almost forgot one thing! The power-ups. There are 3: rapid fire, high jump, faster running. The first two are useless... The high jump is useful, but only in very, very specific obstacles and don't play a role in the general game. The speed one, however, is really, really fun! The game is slow paced, making timing more controlled and important (not in a good way), but the speed power up changes a lot. The game suddenly becomes fast paced, making you time jumps while in the air, trying to traverse the levels quickly and in a risky way. It's great! Unfortunately, it's only used is a few levels, and never an explored machanic. Makes it feel like the developers didn't really try and see where the fun in their game was... Oh well.If there is a revamping of the game, please, please, make it faster, and more interesting!Ah, one last thing. The game has 5 music tracks. Some are nice. But they have no solid connection to each other, and they just play... one after another. It's like you having your own 5 tracks in Winamp, on the background. They just repeat, one after another... What's the point? Just goes to show how little thought went into the game. It's kind of sad, sometimes. I'd like to think that when someone makes a game, he would think of the experience as a whole, and try to make every aspect interesting... and then I look at Steam and I get disappointed.",

        "text": "Mechanic Escape is a very solid platformer! It's very linear and rhythmical, where timing is more important than actual mechanical mastery. Think more Rayman, less Super Meat Boy (the iOS Rayman, anyway, never played the others).Every obstacle is designed to be easily surpassed if you time everything right, making it easier the faster you go. There are collectibles in each level, but they generally serve as a guide/help, instead of a hinderance. There are 50 little guys spread around, almost delineating the optimal path. Then, there are 5 bigger ones that are usually in alternate paths, but are just as fast as the normal paths, only you need to pay attention to where they may appear. There are 80 levels, spread out on 4 worlds. Every level is beaten in about 40 seconds and there are no checkpoints in each level, you have to beat it all in one go. You can only jump and run, basically. The running could have even been scrapped (again, iOS Rayman) and the little guy run automatically, since you can't really stop, most of the time.However, there are lots of different obstacles, slowly introduced as you progress. They're introduced elegantly, usually in a harmless manner, as a warning.There's also a Boss of sorts in every level. In certain sections, that Boss pursues you, sometimes even shoots bullets/lasers at you. This is a very limiting obstacle, making it almost impossible to stop and think before starting another challenge. It is good, sometimes, keeping you on your toes! It's a pressure point of the level.Later on, however, it can be frustrating and very, very limiting, to the point that you'll die dozens of times before pulling everything off perfectly.The first 3 worlds are really enjoyable! Everything is well timed and fun to go through. The last world is a huge spike in difficulty... I was halfway through the 4th world with less than 600 deaths. The last 10 level cost me 300 lives. That's a bit disproportional, isn't it? ... Well, everything is timed just slightly off. I'm not sure it's intentional. But it makes the game a lot harder. Like... a lot. Instead of running through it elegantly, as before, you have to find ways of tricking the Boss, and even slow yourself, but not too much, otherwise it'll catch you...I was really frustrating. Usually, I had 3-7 deaths, sometimes around 20 deaths on hard levels. On the 4th chapter, some levels were around 30 deaths, one of them even reaching 80, and another 60. Granted, there were some easy levels as well, but the frustrating ones painted the picture, for me.The biggest \"problem\" is how floaty the controls are. This is intentional. And it works mostly well, for the first 60-70 levels. Because the levels are well designed around these controls. For the reasons stated before, it becomes really frustrating, since the floatiness doesn't allow for fine-tuned movement.Also, the achievements do not reward perfecting the levels (all collectibles) at all, and there doesn't seem to be Time leaderboards nor achievements... I think it would only benefit a game like this, but oh well.All in all, it's still a solid game. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It looks good, the music is pretty cool, and it can provide a challenge. Give it a go! Oh, and it's nowhere near as difficult as Super Meat Boy. I mean, not even close. So don't worry about that. It can still appeal to more \"casual\" platformer fans.",

        "text": "Tengami is a beautiful game, with a lot of thought into its design, no doubt. The pop-up book style and the more traditional Japanese aesthetic are impressive, and the soundtrack adds a lot to the game's atmosphere. In that sense, it's great!However, the overall \"game\" just falls short. As a game, it has nothing. Even as an \"experience\", it just feels empty.It's clearly an iOS game, and not in a good way. Perhaps it's good to have on your phone and play 10-15 minutes before going to bed, but nothing else.So, what are the problems?First, the sound design in general isn't very well implemented. Half of the time, the tracks simply stop playing (and I'm not sure what triggers it, they simply stop) leading to silence... In the other half, the tracks stop, and another begins. It just feels unnatural and \"breaks the immersion\". What could have been a really nice experience will leave a bitter taste after that.Then, there's the problem with the puzzles/story. The puzzles are meaningless. At least they seem to be, and the game never does anything to change that. There aren't really unique a well explored mechanics. 70% of them are simply trial and error -- although not the frustrating kind -- simply going up and down through the pop-up book's layers. They're ok, but are simply there to make time, I guess. The other 30% require a bit more attention from the player: for example, spotting little characters more or less hidden in the pages, or counting the symbols hidden in structures. But even these are meaningless. They have no real connection with the experience, other than being puzzles set in a pop-up book.The story is presented through a couple of cutscenes, but there really isn't much of it, at all. At the end of each chapter, you're presented with a Haiku as well (I think that's what it is, anyway: a very short poem, composed with 3 phrases, aiming to capture a single moment). The problem with that is that you don't really have access to those poems after seeing them... if you didn't write them down, it's not really conducive to interpretation or whatever else...Again, the puzzles are simple, but not elegant or meaningful. They're simply there.It's a cool visual idea, but then they've done absolutely nothing with it, game-wise. A great example of an iOS game that actually uses every aspect to deliver a very interesting experience, despite being very clearly design for mobile phones and short playtime, is Year Walk. That game is brilliant. And every single puzzle and scene is meaningful in some way. And the game makes you replay it several times, each time giving you a bit more insight into its meaning. If you're looking for that kind of experience, definitely get Year Walk. It's unfortunate that Tengami is as empty as it is... It's a very beautiful game, but it's just that. Pretty to look at. Here's hoping that they do something more with their next games!",

        "text": "Pretty good FPS! Old-school in the sense of Painkiller and Serious Sam, rather than DOOM and DukeNukem.The level design isn't as interesting as the latter, but the game still has room for a few secrets for you to uncover. Each weapon is unique, with various uses, although the slow upgrade system doesn't encourage experimentation with the weapons (it's balanced for you to have 80-85% of the upgrades by the end of the game).Still, even though it may take a while, each weapon is pretty satisfying. Wave uponh wave of enemies. The big problem is how resilient they are to damage. Even a rocket launcher is rather inneffective... Then again, I played on Hard mode. It's... really hard. Sometimes frustrating, putting high damage enemies with you into very small spaces. But, despite that big flaw, the game is still a hell of a lot of fun!Visually, it's nothing short of impressive, with a huge, cyberpunk city. The lighting system is pretty good as well.Then, there's the physic's system. It's a big part of what makes this game awesome to play! Everything explodes and breaks apart, and you can basically shoot everything long after they're dead. It gets a bit too resource intensive, but it's worth it.The levels are a bit too long to my taste (usually 40minutes +), seeing how much you die. Checkpoints are really unforgiving as well, with the game lacking a \"quicksave\" feature.But hey, if you're looking for a game that is purely about the shooting, with little other distractions, definitely check this out!",

        "text": "This is a really good rhythm game! It suffers from a number of issues, but it's still worth your time and money, if you're into this genre. The graphics are very well done, but they're too obtrusive, often obscuring vital information. It's strange to see such a big focus on the graphics, when rhythm games function almost without any graphics. It's about timing and precision. The game has several little details on bosses and backgrounds that are lost, since you can't be appreciating how pretty a game looks when playing a game of this type that requires lots of concentration.Oh well. It does have some options to disable effects and add guide-lines, so the problem can be diminished.The game only has 10 songs, and thus, 10 levels on the campaign. While that may sound very little, take in mind that there are 6 difficulty settings, which creates different levels, effectively. It also have a very extensive challenge system. Too extensive, honestly. The challenges are the same levels as in the campaign, but they start in lower difficulties, and progressively introduce higher ones. They also change rules and unlock a ton of extras. They change color lanes, mirror things, some require perfect timing, etc. etc. Very cool!However, having 130 challenges does get painfully slow.The biggest problem, in my opinion, is how the game never explains itself very well. It's a big issue regarding controls and higher difficulties. While it supports Guitar, Controller and Keyboard, using Keyboard is almost impossible in the 2 highest difficulties. I was playing with a controller. It was wonderful. The controls were perfectly timed with the songs, and it felt really good! Until I reached that difficulty wall. So, I tried to find my guitar hero controller and play with it. Well, at that point, it was very difficult to transition between the 2 controllers, with wildly different control methods. I had to go back a few difficulty levels and relearn everything, with a less interesting game, as the levels were slower than what I was used it.All of that could have been avoided if the game was more transparent. Unfortunately, since it didn't do well on Playstation, the developer decided to shift focus away from the guitar... which was a poor decision, in my opinion.So yeah, it's not perfect. There's a song that has an awkward transition, but all of the rest are really fun to play! They all have different sections, connecting the songs with the levels very nicely.It's not a genre that we see often on PC, so definitely give it a go, it's great!P.S.: I played 10.6 hours without any issue of this sort, but the game just reset my progress after this whole time. I was only playing the challenges at this point, and was pretty far into it. I didn't feel like doing it all again, so I decided to just drop the game.Still very much enjoyed my time with it!",

        "text": "I'd advise against buying this one. Play Hero Siege, instead. Both games sort of hinge on the same principle by going overkill with destructibles and number of exploding enemies. Honestly, while this game would have been something neat to see as freeware and a developer's experiment on making a game satisfying to play, it's simply not worth paying for, at all. This is, of course, my opinion - other people seem to be enjoying this, although this game is being given away for free.They use particle effects, permanent bodies and bloodstaines, screenshake and overall a buttload of money and numbers on the screen to make the player feel overpowered. That aspect is quite nice, although it's very clearly an amateur take on it. With some refinement it could be really satisfying. Despite having this one nice aspect, the whole game seems like simply filler, and it doesn't do anything new.The games has probably dozens of classes, which sounds like a lot. However, they mostly play the same. There are only 2 attack: main and special. Special attacks drain mana. The main attacks between classes vary simply in range and power, but they're all essentially the same.The game has one mechanic: you run faster is you're running in the same direction as the mouse pointer - i.e., you can't aim while running away.It's an interesting mechanic, for sure!But the game just swarms you with enemies, it's too zoomed in, attacks are way too big and obfuscating, as are the enemy corpses. Nothing interesting in the environments, you can't see what you're getting hit by, you often get stuck in random terrain that you can't see properly... It was a fun game to play for 30 minutes. Again, if it was a freeware game like Cactus' or JW's, it would have been cool. The developers gets to create a name for himself while trying something new, and people get a couple of minutes of enjoyment. Once you have to pay for it... it's just not worth it, at all.Very unpolished and bland, in general. Again, try Hero Siege - not perfect, but far better than this in every respect.",

        "text": "Being a fan of Ace Team's previous games (The Zeno Clash series especially), I was really looking forward to playing this! Even more after seeing the character design, it looked awesome!Unfortunately, while I enjoyed a some of my time with the game, it simply fails as a whole. It has several things that could have been really interesting, separately, but they just don't fit, and the whole design falls apart.The game is supposed to be a fighting and roguelite hybrid. And one of the coolest aspect was how the game \"evolves\" as people beat the final Boss. This turned out to be an artificial evolution: basically just a series of updates with different moves for the Bosses, more bosses, modes, etc. Sure, it's a cool idea to keep updating a game, but I was expecting something more substancial that would make people want to go back to the game.If you're experienced in fighting games, you may have an easier time with this title. If not, prepare for a loooot of frustration. The game simply throws you into the Abyss, with a 1minute tutorial on your first minute of playtime. Good luck interiorizing anything worthwhile without context... Anyway, the game is extremely reliant on mechanics like move cancelling and timed blocked which are never taught in any way. If you already know about it, you may be able to use it. Otherwise, the controls will simply feel really sluggish and unresponsive. When you start a move, you'll have to wait for the animation to completely finish. Unless, you spend upgrade points to get cancellation points... Something that isn't wel explained either.Regardless, after spending a bunch of hours trying to learn the mechanics, I felt pretty satisfied with the combat, in general. However...The roguelite elements are really bad. Like... the elements just don't connect properly.So, you have the main character, but you can capture an enemy to switch with. When your main character dies, you'll have a weaker soldier to play with. If you can reach an altar, your main character respawns. This, in theory, would be a reliable way of having a second chance. Great!But, there's a huge issue with it... While you run through the Abyss, you find shopkeeper and items (Weapons and Equipment) that are really useful. But, when you die, you lose most of it. As the soldier, you can pick a couple up, but the rest are lost. The choice of the ones destroyed is also random, making it really frustrating to lose an item you wanted to keep. On shops, you can also buy \"camp tokens\", which you can use in altars as a checkpoint. Once again, sounds great. But you lose ALL of your items when you respawn. The result is: hey, I'm farther into the dungeon, cool. However, I have absolutely no equipment, so I might as well just kill myself, since all progress is basically lost.You see this works? This completely defeats the point of these cool little mechanics, since they're all useless. Ok, let's assume you want to finish the game without items. Sure. That's where the fighting problems come in.On normal mode, the game is fairly easy. I beat it on my third try. And I've beaten it like... 8 times, or something? Sure, I still died several times, but it wasn't very interesting, with as many victories in such a short time.So I switched to nightmare mode. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hell... this is the most frustating experience I've had with a game, lately. It's not very different than the normal mode, except that every group of enemies is bigger. Bosses now have an elite ally. You'll be faced with groups of 5+ enemies... It's a mess.In a fighting game, full of stun times after hits, you'll just be juggled by most bosses and even groups of enemies. As soon as you stand up, you'll be hit by another enemy. Then there are projectiles flying in your direction... it's a mess. If you're experienced in fighting games, you may have a chance. Otherwise, you'll have to waste hours and hours to learn how to cope with it. And it's simply not fun. It feels unfair to have such a number of enemies on you. And then, if you die,  the \"second chances\" are completely useless.This was a huge disappointment, and it's a shame. The game has lots of different character to learn, and the game could have been really good. Unfortunately, the rogue-lite elements simply don't work, and the game isn't balanced. No good tutorialization, the story seems really interesting, but ends up unexplored, ... Oh well.Maybe I was expecting too much out of it, but frustration put me off. If the respawn/checkpoint system was reworked, I think the game would have benefited a lot. As it is... not so much. I hope their next game is more balanced, because the talent is clearly there!",

        "text": "This is really, really good!From what I had heard of Papers, Please, I was expecting a very unique game, but also something that was very limited in terms of gameplay and variety. Boy, I was wrong!So, everyone must have heard about the general premise by now. The whole moral conundrum between the people you decide to pass, despite of their document's validity, is a very important aspect. However, there are several different \"storylines\" that you come across. And that's where some of the big decisions come into play, as you try to balance family and principle. There are several ways you can play this game, each character you encounter encorporating a different trait of your play style.I felt genuinely bad with some of the decisions I made. And genuinely good as well! And it's not all that common for a game to make me pause and think about what I'm about to do. There are some really memorable moments and characters. Overall, you should stick with your decisions, as you definitely feel the repercussions of most of them. Use your better judgement and do good for Arstotzka!Replayability is certainly there, although I doubt I'll ever do it. I'm quite satisfied with the experience I got out of the game, honestly.However, there are lots of ways where you can choose different! The campaign should remain largely the same, though, regarding the \"filler\" moments. Of course, those are necessary for the game to have meaning! I support that, it just hinders replayability, if you deem that necessary.Definitely give this one a go!",

        "text": "Apotheon is one hell of a Metroidvania game. Really great execution, for the most part!Look at the game. I don't think I need to say much else. Sure, the game itself is awesome, but the visuals are a big part of what makes it stand out.The biggest strength in the combat is how the game is physics driven, but not like most of the lazy games that use a default physics engine with no consideration for gameplay. No no no, Apotheon uses physics almost perfectly, making the combat feel very impactful, and the general game is very satisfying to play. Platforming is cool, but above that is how you can break virtually everything, and the corpse ragdoll effects are really fun to play with!Beautiful lighting system! Simple, but it's still very nicely done. And it's used as a gameplay tool as well, so it's not just something to look pretty.Regarding the visuals, I think they went a bit overboard with the visual effects. Most of them were unnecessary and actually taken away from the whole \"ancient pottery\" aesthetic it has going for it. Looks a bit too polished and sparkly for pottery. But hey, it's still really unique!I was a bit disappointed with the story... It was very linear, and... \"original\". In this case, however, original isn't good.Drawing for mythology, there are tons of stories worth telling. What they've done, is simply to draw from the pantheon and some of the Gods' relationships, and made a betrayal/revenge story of their own, about a human who kills Gods... meh. Honestly, I expected things to be a bit different. Oh well.The combat can be a bit clunky, at times, because physics. Still feels very nice to send corpses flying around and throwing javellins at innocent Gods.Definitely give this one a go! Could have been better, story-wise, but the game itself is brilliant. Lots of different approaches and little mechanics that are barely used, but that you're free to explore. Awesome game!",

        "text": "Novelist in a very interesting game, and one that I enjoyed more than I expected, actually!When I started, it felt very much like Gone Home, only with more characters than objects to help you piece the story together. Also, there is a ghostly mystery surrounding the whole thing. Too similar, I thought. However, by the end, this succeeded for me, as a result of the choices you make throughout the game.In fact, if you can identify with some parts of the characters, this game can really make you question a lot, not just about the game. Each choice felt significant, with trying to balance each character's goals with their problems, and I often had to \"put myself in their situations\", which worked surprisingly well!I've played the game once and I'm satisfied with that. Replaying it would probably destroy some of its charm. There are tiny things the change as the game advances, and the whole thing comes off very coherently.Also, very nice music! And it's done in a unique way: as I understood it, the music is procedurally played, meaning, the game has a pool of little musical phrases/scales, and they play at random. A bit like Thomas Was Alone.As a result, the music is not memorable at all, but rather textural. It sets the ambience very well. I thought it totally fit the experience, being very calm and serene, with some moments of dissonance. I'll be listening to the OST. If you want some narrative experiment, give this one a go. It has non-trivial interaction, for once! Solid recommendation, on this one.",

        "text": "Huh... it's hard to recommend Return NULL. It doesn't do anything badly, per se, but there's nothing to recommend it as a game, really. It's basically a very limited, linear, plot driven comic book. And a really, really short one. While the writting isn't all that bad, this is completely unfit for a game. You have no agency at all. There are some dialogue choices, but they don't seem to change anything. It's all an illusion of choice, while you get the same result regardless.I don't like plot-driven media in general, so your opinion may be very different from mine.But here's the thing. This game is a big setup. They try to have some emotional impact in the beginning, but mostly fail, since you have about 2 minutes to make the emotional bond. Too fast and in your face to achieve anything, personally.Then, they try to present the world and its dystopian issues, but it barely has any content for it to work. There's no exploration, no talking to interesting characters... everything is placed to move the plot forward. And the plot isn't any good either. It may become good, but it's a 30-40 minutes game, at most. And a big part of that is walking back and forth, so it's not really a good measure.The images are static as well. The game is gorgeous. I really like the look of it. But... it would look just as good as a comic book.Only, it would have more pictures...The music is alright as well, and sets the mood correctly. No interesting puzzles, no interesting characters, no exploration, nothing. There's absolutely nothing that makes this benefit as game. It only hurts it, honestly. Because it creates situations for the player to \"interact\", i.e. use screwdriver to open something, or use piers to cut wires... They don't add anything to the game, they're simply there, making things clunky. Yeah, not a fan at all. It's not broken or anything, it's pretty solid at what it does. It's just that what it does is not much.",

        "text": "I was looking forward to trying this game a while back, although I had no clue it came from Zachtronics, developer of the infamous SpaceChem. I haven't played much of SpaceChem yet. It intimidates me, and I'd like to devote my full attention to it, when the time comes -- soon, I'd say.So, when I knew this came from the same people, I wasn't sure if I wanted to play yet. I did anyway.Well, Ironclad Tactics is a different take on the lane strategy \"genre\", with the added complexity layer of deck-building.This game is really, if you don't know what you're expected to do. This is mostly a deck-building game, as other reviewers have stated. Each level has a different challenge for your to overcome, and you overcome it with a different deck, mostly. Certainly, tactics are also very important, but a good tactic will do very little if you don't have the correct deck.While the concept is interesting, and I did enjoy the game, I can't say that it's perfect. At all. It has several design points that I heartily disagree with, and make it simply a \"good\" game. Which isn't bad, mind you. Just not quite what I expected after trying SpaceChem.I've completed the game (without the DLC). Done all the optional objectives as well as game plus. It was a challenging task, for sure, but also very rewarding!Each level has a main objective. There are several different types of levels: there's the common level, in which you try to get victory points by moving your units into the end of the map, there's an \"hold position\" level, in which you try to survive for x number of turns, and there's the Boss levels. Each of them play very different. Level variation is also pretty good, which is surprising. It seems very limited with the 3-5 lane maps, but there is a surprising number of subtle changes that make all the different. Then, there are optional objectives. Some are puzzle levels -- these were easy, but really great! Basically, they teach you a certain mechanic with that: limited deck with 3 or 4 cards, and you have to make the best out of it. Unfortunately, there were only 3 or 4 of these levels.Then, there are some that make you gain VP by other means than moving units to the end of the lane. There are some that make you play with a completely different deck: don't use Y faction, for example.All of these provide interesting challenges.Now, what's wrong with it, exactly?Well, you unlock cards by completing levels and secondary objectives. However, since this is such a deck-oriented game, you'll often be missing the cards you need for a given deck. And so, you have to push through some challenges, until you can go back and complete the secondary objectives. It has a very awkward pacing, like that. Some game encourage you to play previous levels better, but this one does that weirdly, since you can only play some of the previous levels better, since you're missing cards.You'll have to go back and forth a few times, but it's doable. Just not as elegant as I would have liked.Then, there's the random elements. Argh, the randomness...!So, you build a deck. Great. Then, you have to hope that you draw the correct cards at the right moments. One bad draw can screw you over and make you restart a level. Oh, but wait: there's no restart button! I'll talk about it later.Yeah, lots of restarting, until you get the right draws. It's... not to my liking. Maybe it works in multiplayer. It certainly works in most card game. But here, it's just a matter of restarting... Tactics play a lesser role than the actual cards used, and that's why the randomness doesn't work as well.Also, the decks are very limited -- maximum of 2 factions, exactly 20 cards. So, you can't really create as much variety, or even guarantee to get a certain card, since there are at most 4 or 5 of each. It's an interesting limitation, and it requires some creativity to beat levels. But then again, the randomness is frustating, since it's a matter of trying over and over until you get the right draws that you envisioned all along.Now, about the lack of a restart button. I don't know why it is. It makes little sense. Perhaps it's simply a question of the designer saying \"create the right deck and you won't have to restart\". Maybe...The game came off as a bit too random for that, but I don't know. Just a minor gripe made bigger with the amount of restarting...Honestly, this is a very frustrating game, at times. Especially when you first start, not exactly sure how it works, it will be daunting. But if you keep trying, you'll learn how the game works, how the AI works, and how certain levels can be easily beat with the right decks.NewGame+ is almost a whole different game, also! Don't just complete the main campaign, thinking that's everything. It's definitely not.Well, not a perfect game, but certainly a very rewarding experience, if you feel like a challenge!",

        "text": "Beware. As it stands, the game has very little content, despite being in development for a while.Edit: after talking with the developer, I changed the previous paragraph.The game has about 15 minutes of gameplay! I have more since I was exploring the mechanics a bit more, to see if there was anything beyond the lackluster surface. And then to farm cards. There's nothing.First off, I've found his youtube channel. There's a video of this game from September 2013... it looked identical. Then, the game entered Early Access a month ago, and has basically no content. The game's planned time in EA is 6 months. I can't think of how they'll pull it off in 5 months, seeing that this game has existed for a looong time and is as it is.Also, the developer is claiming to be porting the game over to Unreal because of user feedback... out of nowhere, essentially. There was a poll of sorts, but the whole thing makes little sense.Oh well, you now have the shady information I stumbled upon. On to the game, then.Well, it looks like old X-COM, but is actually a top-down shooter. You point to stuff and shoot them. Enemies take a bunch of shots to die and there's very little feedback. They'll always shoot at where you are, and their bullets are fast, so you have to stand as far as possible and \"circle\" with the 8 direction system. Not very interesting at all. The guns all feel the same. There's a shotgun that shoots exactly as the laser rifle... only damage changes... It's not very good.There's a seemingly complete inventory and upgrade system built into the game, which is quite cool. You collect 2 currencies in the levels and then upgrade your stuff. That would be cool, if there was anything worth upgrading. For now, it's just numbers like Health, Armor, Damage, Rate of Fire, etc. And as I said, the guns feel really, really bad. You click, and a projectile is created. No muzzle flash, no recoil, no screenshake, nothing. It's very, very, very basic.The game looks pretty nice, though! It's a bit rough overall, but I really like the style. There are a few visual glitches, but nothing overwhelming.The levels consist of \"kill these 3 enemies\", then move another place to \"kill these 2 guys\". There are only 2 enemy types, and their AI is non-existant. They're stacionary, and they shoot at you.There's also a Boss fight. Nothing too complex, but it's cool that it exists.I mean... this is not good at all. The only redeeming factor is the visual style. And even that, it's not good enough for recommendation.Honestly, I'd like to see this be a cool game. But, with all of the above, this does not seem serious at all. And something that most people with *little* programming experience could put together in a couple of hours. I'll update this if anything changes.",

        "text": "Unholy Heights is certainly an interesting game... I've never played anything like it, but then again, I'm not very familiar with the Japanese indie scene.Well, you can certainly say that it's a very Japanese game. You're Devil, and you're managing an Hotel, gathering monsters to defend it, and eventually conquer the world, after \"Natural\" selection does its job.Basically, you'll have to buy more and better furniture for their rooms, satisfying each monster's necessities. For example, fiery monsters require hot temperatures, while icy monsters require cold. There are a variety of items you'll have to buy to satisfy each creature, but the learning process is gradual and pretty good, honestly. You set the pace of the game by when you accept quests, and also have 3 different speed that you can switch between easily. There are 3 or 4 tiers, each one adding a floor to your hotel. Between the transition, you'll have repeatable quests to grind gold, basically. With each tier, the game gets harder, and you'll also get more money.It's a very linear progression system in that way. The game itself was fun at first, but seemed to get really repetitive later on, especially if you don't understand the creatures very well. Since they all start out weak, it also doesn't encourage experimentation very much (with the exception of the tier transition, in which you'll have to hire different monsters -- experiment then!).Still, what makes it shine is the flavour. Each monster is trying to get a profession as well as a love partner and have kids. And all of that has text associated with it. They're always performing actions as well, like \"reading erotic magazines\" or \"engaging in pillow-talk\". It's weird. But it's also unique, and certainly stands out for that.The combat itself is very simple, but it has some depth to it, in the order that you send in your monsters by range, HP, and even the position of their own room can be important. The game got pretty hard by the end, but I was probably not playing optimally. There is room for advanced strategy and min-maxing, but it's not a necessity.Overall, if you're looking for a casual, but quirky game, you should give this one a try! For 4\u20ac it's certainly worth it.",

        "text": "Darwinia is really great. Perhaps not the best \"game\" or RTS out there, but there are some really unique aspects to it, if you can get past the frustrating and confusing first missions.This is very clearly an indie game, but it's one of a kind we don't see too often, nowadays. Everyone can make some kind of game, so our focus has shifted and broadened from what it was back then, when mainly programmers and computer scientists could make a game on their own. And this game shows that perspective a lot. This game is you trying to clean up an accident that happened with sentient AIs that downloaded a Spam e-mail's virus. And the way that the story is presented is clearly from a more technical point of view which is not all that common, nowadays. I'd think of Darwinia more as a Sandbox than as a game. Honestly, the campaign wasn't all that good. The game hasn't aged well (suprisingly, the graphics still looks fairy modern). It doesn't explain its mechanics well at all, and I was stuck on the first two levels for completely different reasons. For example, the missions don't end. You'll get a message that your objectives are complete, and then you manually leave the level. It's... strange. And if you miss the message, good luck finding what's wrong!Also, a lot of the missions boil down to \"wars of attrition\", while you figure out a decent strategy.I thought of dropping the game after the first couple of level.By the end, however, it gets really good. Once you get past the micro managing a squad with a very awkward path-finding, you get to spawning dozens and dozens of Darwinians, and exploding dozens of the enemies at once. Then it gets really cool!It's mostly a Conquest game, where you try to spawn as many Darwinians and move them to a ConqueredPoint to spawn even more of them, and eventually conquer the whole map. But something about the way its done is really charming, and it's just fun to see the AI do their thing.I didn't enjoy the campaign, for the most part. But certainly something to try out!",

        "text": "Unrest is an interesting interactive piece of fiction, and it has some really solid ideas regarding the issues it addresses (even if in a fantasy setting) and the way the narrative is told.The most interesting to me, and a point that should be stressed in video-game storytelling, in my opinion, is not to always give the game a defined plot. Plots aren't very interesting to me. What is interesting, however, is giving you a setting, with questions and different approaches. Then, you can make choices and see how the world reacts.I can't be bothered to remember a plot. Knowing the world I was \"living\" in, however, is something that sticks with me.This game makes you stick with your decisions (although there's also a saving system, if you so wish to use), but it's not perfect in that regard. There were many occasions when the game blocked me some paths that seemed available... it's not very consistent with the doors it closes. One mis-interpretation of the dialogue and you'll have to play the rest of the game with a choice you didn't intend to make. Oh well.But I'm giving it a thumbs down. Why is that?Well, above all else, because you play many different characters, several of them in opposing sides of the conflict. It's really hard to \"role-play\" in this manner.Also, with the amount of character switching that goes on in the game, it's really hard to keep track who's who.Regardless, the characters you play aren't all that well defined before you start, and will often be in conflict with your previous character. It's... awkward, honestly. I'd rather play one character and commit to a certain persona, and then have a friend play another character, with a different persona, and see how the world developed. I don't know, role-playing this many characters in quick succession just feels wrong, especially with the lack of previous characterization. I couldn't really \"defend a point\", since the next character might defend the complete opposite.The game itself isn't bad. The \"game\" part is a bit amateur, with animations not really matching the background's perspectives and some clunky systems... but I think it's worth a shot. It's trying something different, and definitely something I'd like to see more of. However, after playing this, I've got to admit that it was completely immersion breaking to be constantly switching characters, often with conflicting views of the world. I just couldn't play all of those roles at once.Would be really cool to see a multiplayer version -- Each person chooses a character and makes their own choices. It would probably have me much more invested!Still, looking forward to their other games!",

I was curious when I saw it, and I certainly didn't expect a hard platformer from its presentation.Still, I gave it a go. It infuriated me time and time again. Honestly, I thought I'd just do a negative review many times because of how frustrating it was. It's the kind of difficulty that will feel unfair and will make any flaw stick out like a sore thumb.But I stuck with it 'till the end. And honestly, that was the worst part. But I've managed to finish it. And surprisingly, I did another run after finishing the game. I'm pretty sure that beating the game took me 3.5 hours. 1.5 of which were spent just on the last level!Still, I was curious to see how much I had improved. And I beat the game in 20 minutes...What?It's strange. And yet, that last level required you to perfect every single skill that you had been exposed to in the previous levels.Despite how infuriating it is, there's something quite masterful about that last level. It's a really long level, requiring you to lose lots of time repeating the same sections over and over and over... but in the end, it pays out!The game has some bugs that will make you die unfairly. The game has hidden obstacles that you won't see until it's too late. The freakin' music doesn't have continuity, meaning that you'll be listening to the same intro to every single song until you're bleeding from your ears. There's a Running button that you never have to unpress. Why is it even a button, then?!Some of the mechanics don't work quite as you would expect...So yeah... it's flawed. And its flaws make the game very unfair, at times, and incredibly frustrating.But it's 2$, and it has a beautiful artstyle. AND, for all its flaws, it still managed to show signs of brilliance at the end. Personally, I think it's too frustrating to recommend to 99% of people. Despite of that, though, there's talent here, and I'll be looking forward to what else comes from these developers!",

        "text": "ContextAaru's Awakening is a hardcore platformer, with a unique, hand-drawn graphic style.I first saw this game featured in GameJolt, and assumed that it was a result of a game jam.When I saw it come to Steam, I was pretty excited to try it out.Unfortunately, this is a game that seems to be constantly in an internal conflict regarding exactly what it's trying to achieve.I've completed the game in about 3 hours, and then played a bit more to get some better times, and look around a bit more. If you go for the leaderboards, you'll certainly take fairly longer. There's also an hardcore mode that seems infuriating.PresentationThe game is beautiful. I just played Child of Light, from a much larger company, and this game still looks pretty damn good!Everything is highly detailed, the creatures look alien (in a good way) and the Bosses have a really nice design to them.The menus and loading screens are also highly stylized, and give the game a very unique vibe right of the bat.Even the animation is very nice! The main character follows the mouse-point/analog stick, with different walking animations depending on where you're pointing. It's a pretty rare thing, especially with indie games. It's very well done!However, despite being a beautiful game, it completely misses its target in regards to its genre : hardcore platformer.I'll go over some crucial aspects of the genre (regarding its visuals): Conveying information quickly, making it very clear what will kill you and what will not;Good differentiation between foreground and background elements;Keeping distractions to a minimum;Clear hitboxes;The second and third are, of course, to aid the first, the most important.Of all of these, this game only manages the last. Its hitboxes are well limited.All of the rest, unfortunately, has been largely ignored, it seems.The game uses mostly one color palette, per worldOf course, it's an aesthetic choice. And the game looks good. BUT, when everything has very similar colors, you simply cannot convey information quickly. Many, many deaths have happened because I couldn't see the obstacles.In a game that requires fast reflexes, obstacles are usually identified by peripheral vision. This game has none of that, resulting in a very trial and error experience.There's also the fact that some foreground elements seem obstacles, and you can never be sure until you run into them.There's no time to appreciate its visualsIt's a fast paced game, with leaderboards. Your objective is to cross the levels as fast as you can. So... where exactly, does the player take the time to look around and be amazed by the game's amazing style? ... There's no time for it. Even the bosses. I've looked at them, but not for long at all -- otherwise, I'd be killed.And it's really unfortunate. The game is beautiful, but it's mostly wasted potential.The visuals are in complete conflict with the gameplay, instead of taking advantage of each of their highlights.Other than that, feedback could be stronger, but isn't too much of an issue, as you die in mostly 1 hit. The \"death screen\" is also kind of annoying, but hey...The Music is also pretty good! It's very passive, though, with mostly eastern sounding melodies, with some tribaltextures. I enjoyed it, and it loops well enough. It also doesn't restart when you die (that I noticed, as least), and usually keeps playing, even when you go to the level select screen. I would have liked it to be a bit more active, but it's mostly personal preference. It works well in the game.I'll give the Story a paragraph, this time around. I think it was cool, to give the game some context, but I also have 2 issues with it.The story is \"original\" (i.e. not taken from somewhere else), but it was pretty clich\u00e9. What it did, however, was give a bit of flavour about the mythological nature of the game, which is cool! And it has a nice cyclical theme to it.One of the problems is that it was very barebones -- which is understanding in an hardcore platformer. However, I would have expected some more to go along the visuals.The other one is that it's told exclusively outside the game. It's just a narrated piece of text between each world...General Structure & MechanicsThe game has 3 tutorial level, and then 4 \"worlds\", with 4 levels each, plus a Boss-fight in the end.Your character can walk around and jump, with a couple of abilities. The first is a Dash, while in the air. This dash can break some types of walls, and otherwise works as a double jump, essentially.The other is Teleportation. You shoot a little ball of light, and then teleport to it. This ball richochets some surfaces, sticks to others, and can also be destroyed by some (and enemies). You can also kill some enemies by teleporting directly inside them.With that, it's mostly a game of avoiding enemies, spikes, and pools (and other hazards).It's also sort of physics driven. I say sort of, because the physics are extremely artificial, and often cause more problems than it solves.In-depth look mechanical issuesTeleporting into enemies to kill themEnemies kill you with one touch. I think the problem is self evident. If you do as much as miss the enemy by a pixel, you'll touch them after the teleport and simply die. This happens quite a lot. There's also the problem of \"enemies that can not be teleported into\" not showing any sign of that. So, you can also repeatedly try to kill them until you realize why you can't. Enemies also shoot projectiles that will kill you and the teleportation ball. It's often a mess, with several enemies on screen.Countless cheap and unavoidable deathsBack to trial and error. There are enemies that come from off-screen. There are other that walk into you immediately, when you reach a new screen (usually Boss fights that rely on teleporting into another screen). Then, there are huge spiked balls that fall when you enter a new area...The game is full of these deaths. You're focusing on one particularly challenging section, and when you're almost reaching the end, the game \"surprises\" you with more death. It can be annoying, since it's just about memorization.Artificial physics The game has some ramps to accelerate you, and throw you into a fast paced section. However, these don't actually function according to physics. When you touch them, your speed simply goes from 2 to 50. Even if you touch the extremity of it, you gain exactly the same speed. If you want to slow down and do the section in another way... tough luck.Then, there's falling acceleration. Of course, your speed gets higher as you fall. Unfortunately, the teleportation conserves that acceleration, which means that successfuly pulling a second one in the air is virtually impossible. I could have seen some interesting sections, if you could teleport and reset your speed... Yet another limitation.Too punishingLevel design-wise, the challenges seem to long. Usually (and I've mentioned this in the Yury game), platformers have platforms that make you safe. This game seems to think that's too easy, and almost every platform falls. This stretches the challenges a lot, at times, and makes the game quite frustrating. There's one chance for everything. You can't recover from your mistakes. If you miss a jump, too bad... Everything falls and everything is designed to kill you. It's simply not fun. And it's not a fair challenge either. (Super Meat Boy is one of my favourite games)ConclusionIt's an ambitious effort! But, for the reasons above, the negatives far outweigh the positives. Ultimately, it's made of pieces that don't fit together... Still, the talent it clearly there, and I'll look forwward to their future games.",

        "text": "ContextChild of Light is what many call a AAA indie game. It's an hybrid between a JRPG and a (light) platformer, from Jeffrey Yohalem, best known for Far Cry 3. It's quite the leap, from one game to another!The team who made this game was far smaller, but more focused as a result. It comes from a place of fairy-tales and fantasy worlds, as form of escapism. It's definitely different from what we usually see in videogames, especially from big companies.Its art caught my eye a while ago, and since it was on sale, I decided to finally try it! Unfortunately, due to university, I couldn't play it all in a few days, having to play it sparingly, in the span of 2 weeks instead.It took mee a little over 15hours to beat, with every sidequest done, on \"Expert\" difficulty.PresentationAs I said, its visuals were the first aspect of this game to catch my attention. It instantly reminded me of John Bauer's work (who is rather well known for his Swedish Folktale illustrations -- Paradox's Runemaster was mainly inspired by his art as well!), which was a nice surprise. Later on, as I played, I dug a bit deeper and discovered that it was indeed inspired by not only his artwork, but all of the Golden Age of Illustration, which I didn't know about. Look it up, it's great!The whole game is hand-drawn and painted, with the addition of some 3D animation as well as lighting effects. Comparisons with pop-up books aren't unfounded either, as the game has lots of different layers of textures in the backgrounds, making the game feel very organic. The art in general is rough, almost looking like a draft, but I feel that was intentional. All in all, the game looks great, and certainly unique (!), but I would have liked to see a more detailed version of this style. Again, when I looked the Golden Age of Illustration up, I was amazed with the detailed drawings. Of course, it's very different to make 10-20 drawings than it is to make probably hundreds, for a complete videogame. Still, since it's Ubisoft we're talking about, maybe the idea will be pursued further!The animation also has some really nice details to it! Not unlike Disney or Ghibli's movies, the best part of it is how they animate the little details and creatures that populate the universe. Unfortunately, the enemies weren't nearly as fluid and charismatic. Not sure if it was to reinforce the hand-made feeling of the game or not, but it would have been better to flesh those out a bit more. The backgrounds, though, are full of live, with little creatures constantly popping up. Very nice art direction, overall!The Music was mostly awesome! Honestly, it evoked similar feelings as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did. It has calm moments, composed only with a cello and a piano or a flute, on top of the ambience sounds, and it's great! Besides, there are some musician characters around the world, who play their instruments in tune with the background music -- which I always love!Even the main character plays a flute, at times, making some of the melodies very memorable!The biggest problem, for me, is how grand ideas always seem to fall into the same pit: orchestrating their music. Seriously, it happens way to many times. Instead of the very organic and personal music with just a couple of instruments, the game sometimes feels the need to orchestrate everything. While it gives it a more \"epic\" feel, it's much more impersonal and generic, to me.This happens mostly in the battle tracks, but it was still rather underwhelming, to me.The soundtrack was composed by Coeur de Pirate. I didn't know of her music, and still don't like it very much. Regardless, she has done a brilliant job in here!The sound-effects didn't catch my attention. I'll take that as a positive, since I can be easily annoyed by them!General Structure & MechanicsThe game has 2 main components: 2D platforming, where you explore the world and meet NPCs, and then the JRPG combat system.Neither of them are really noteworthy on their own, but everything in the games comes together rather well, creating a very solid overall experience.The game only has an overworld map, with the ability to fast-travel to previously seen locations. The adventure/exploration aspect of the game is mainly tied to exploring the landscape, finding Coffers with consumables, Attribute bonuses, and Confessions (which I'll explain later on).You get the ability to fly very early on, so platforming, per-se, isn't an issue, here.The maps are fairly open, with lots of (slightly) hidden areas for you to explore. However, the game's RPG side is very stream-lined, making most of the exploration pointless, most of the time. I still did explore, but the payout was very little, because of the combat.The encounters aren't random, as you can see every enemy. You can also avoid them, if you will. I'm assuming this could be fine if you were playing on Casual Mode (\"For those in it just for the story\"), but on Expert, you will need to fight the monsters to level up and face the Boss fights. There's no need to grind, and fighting the monsters you encounter normally should suffice.This is a good way of doing things, although Yahtzee has a good point: Is it worse when the game batters me with the boring stick, or when it puts the boring stick on the ground and leaves me to batter myself with it?Why is the combat streamlined? Well, for example, there's no equipment. Instead, each character has 3 Occuli slots, which are crystals that you can craft, each with a different effect. The 3 slots loosely stand for Weapon, Armor and Trinket. The crystal's effect in every character is the same, when used in the same slot. It's actually quite complicated to explain. And even more to discover their uses, since the interface for it is rather clunky. It was clearly made with a controller in mind, and is missing a lot of keyboard+mouse funcionalities.Each character has a \"talent tree\" with 3 branches, that give them access to different types of skills. You get skill points from leveling up. There's no re-specializing whatsoever, which can be annoying. If you get another character with the same skills you've already chosen in another character, it can be annoying to be stuck with a bunch of useless skills. Overall, though, it didn't prove to be a real issue.Combat dynamics are completely offFor example, you have access to several potions, with stat changing effects (for X turns, in combat). These do exactly the same as characters' skills. So... why use potions? There's almost no reason to! With the exception of H/MP potions.Then, there's the fact that there's a \"progress\" bar, influenced by speed. When you reach the \"Casting\" part of the bar, you're set back, and your spell canceled, if you're hit. This adds strategy to the game, but you're often outnumbered (you have 2 characters, vs. 3 enemies). This gets you interrupt all the time, during Bosses. And it simply feels unfair! It's infuriating, at times, as you almost rendered useless....Then, there's also the fact that buffs don't last long at all, and with only 2 characters, you have to cumbersomely change between characters... it's effective, but very counter-intuitive, and makes the combat less enjoyable than it could have been.I'm already out of words. I didn't like the combat.However, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall experience! I think it dragged on a bit, especially with the sub-par combat. And for each of its faults, the game also had some nice little detail to make up for it!I enjoyed the world and the dialogue (which is all in rhyme -- didn't annoy me at all, I actually found it a nice little effort).It's a very nicely crafted experience, give it a go!",

        "text": "ContextTransistor is a turn-based action RPG (Yeah... I'll explain), and the highly anticipated game from Supergiant, after Bastion.Once again, music and narration play a central role in this game. However, this time around, the mechanics are deeper, while the story is not as important, I feel.This will not be like my other reviews. This is a really good game, with lots of mechanical details that I won't bother to go through. I'll, instead, discuss the main design points that I enjoyed throughout the game!I've played the game twice in a row. The first time around, enjoying the world and the story, and on the second playthrough, trying to complete all of the challenges, experimenting the the different abilities/combinations.PresentationBeautiful game, although it can be a bit overloaded in lighting effects, at timesTransistor feels like an hybrid between Bastion and Shadowrun. It still has the amazing hand-drawn style of their previous game, but in a more sci-fi setting, full of neon lights. While it certainly does look awesome, I felt that there were too many effects being used, at times.That seems intentional, taking the world that they've created, but still...Other than that, animation is spot on, everything feels impactful, everything has great little details, etc. etc. If you've played Bastion, you know what to expect! I prefered that game to Transistor, however, in its general design.There's a humming button! 10/10Seriously, this is too good! I had actually suggested a similar feature when I played Sunless Sea, without knowing that it was a thing in this game.When I played it, I felt like a genious! Haha, honestly, it's a very simple \"tool\", but it can create some really great moments.When you're not engaged in combat, you have the option to press Tab and your character will hum to the background song. She'll sing different notes based on the music and part it's at. But the point is, it gives the player direct control over some emotional moments. These moments are, of course, set up, but by giving you the choice of actually playing a part in them, rather than being just a cutscene, goes a long way to make them more memorable!Besides, it can give the player a few moments to \"rest\" and appreciate the scenery.I love it! One small complaint is that you can't use it in elevators...! I mean, the one aspect of the game where you're stuck in a small space, without the ability to move much, seems like the ideal time to sing a song, no? Oh well...There are some conversation in these elevators, and it may provide better pacing this way, I don't know. Still, I'm just nit-picking.Music is much less organic than Bastion'sAs expected, instead of the folk vibe we had in Bastion, Transistor is far more electronic and metallic. Still, it's very different from what I'd expect in a sci-fi setting. Darren Korb, once again, did a stellar job!While it's not something that I'll probably listen by myself (unlike Bastion's OST - so good!), I think it completely fits the game. The whole audio design is spot-on, and the humming button addition certainly helps it a lot! It feels great to hum with the songs.Narration is in second personOnce again, we have a very present narrator. However, when in Bastion, he also spoke of the character in the 3rd person, as if he was telling the player a story, he is now a character in the game. So, he speaks to you directly. It's a very different approach, but it's also one that works just as well!MechanicsSo, let me explain the turn-based action RPG. Basically, you have a set of abilities to use in real-time. However, your character is NOT an overpowered beast, like, say, Diablo. As such, the game relies of careful planning and combos. To achieve that, you have a \"Tactical/Turn planning phase\", in which you can move around, and use your abilities, as if time had stopped. You choose a sequence of actions, and they play out. These, of course, are very limited. It's almost like having a mana bar. Walking consumes points, and abilities also have a value associated with them. There are nuances in this system that I won't write about (otherwise, this will became a 50-page essay on the game as a whole!). Combining abilitiesUnexpectedly enough, this game has a really unique battle system! Basically, you have a wide range of abilities to choose from, which you unlock as you level up. Each ability has 3 different \"modes\": Active, Upgrade, and Passive. Basically, you combine these abilities in a terminal, to later use in combat. You have 4 active ability slots, each with 2 upgrade slots, and then 4 Passive slots for your character. These numbers are all up to, as you start with less.It's really fun to experiment with all of the different combinations, trying to create the most efficient arsenal against the different enemy types. You can focus on high range, single target attacks, or very up-close and personal explosive AOE. You can also decide to \"charm\" enemies, and have them fight one another, or play as a rogue, striking in their back, and then vanishing. The game accomodates tons of different playstyles!There's a break/hub room, with challenges, and other welcome toysTo break things up, you'll find a backdoor in the game -- I won't spoil what it is. In here, you'll have access to several different challenges. Each door will lead to one type, and has several different levels. These doors will open up as you play through the game.Some focus on Speed, others on Survival or Efficiency. These challenges have several waves, and you can only use a limited number of Functions (abilities) given to you. This is a very effective way of teaching you about different abilities that may have seemed worthless by simply their description. You'll have to try them, and hopefuly learn of new, cool combinations that you can later apply in real combat! The game has a really adaptive difficulty systemThe game has a thing called Limiters. These are basically \"debuffs\", that give you bonus XP - and bragging rights! Even these, are not just \"enemies are stronger/faster/tankier\". There is one that makes them hit twice as hard. However, there's one that limits the number of abilities you can use. One spawns more enemies. Some limit how much you lose when you die (basically, you lose one ability, for a while -- the limiter makes you lose the whole combo, and take longer to \"regenerate\" them)... etc. etc.There are 10 in total. If you use all 10 at once, you'll probably have a hellish time with the game -- in a good way! It makes every move count, only for the min-max type of players.Still, it's great that the game has many options! And it's actually something tangible that you can change in the game, as you play. It's not Easy/Medium/Hard, almost meaningless labels before you even start a game. It's actually aspects that you can change when you're having issues. It's risk-reward well done. Bravo!One last aspect I want to mention.Story and charactersI'm not good at analysing narrative, especially in video games! Just one thing. The characters IN the world carry the story.They're very real, each with a real motivation in the world they're set in, and that's certainly what leads to the events in Transistor. And I love that!However, I don't like the game it's delivered a lot. Each is tied to an ability. Each has 3 parts of their story unlocked by using said ability in one of 3 modes.It encourages experimentation, which is good. But it's too disnjointed. And reading it all at once can be curmbersome.ConclusionHonestly, it's an awesome game! Amazing in almost every aspect, with great design and attention to detail! Absolutely recommend it.",

        "text": "ContextSecrets of R\u00e6tikon is a very unique looking exploration/(light)metroid-vania game in which you control a bird, and have a bigger mission to accomplish, and a cryptic backstory to uncover.It's an interesting game, and I enjoyed a whole lot of it. However, it has a few bugs. That would not be a problem -- except for the fact that these are game-breaking bugs. I haven't been able to finish the game because of it. These bugs are more common than you would think, and many of the threads in the Community Hub are actually asking for help to solve them. As far as I can see, too many people need to tweak the game files in order to finish the game, if at all...Tith this whole preface, expect this to be a biased review. I spent probably 30% of my time with this game very frustrating, and trying to overcome bugs. It's ultimately why I don't recommend this game.PresentationThe game looks amazing!The main attraction, for me, is how they've done colors. The game is very geometrical, mostly full of triangle, with each one of them having a different shade.I can't explain it very well, but look at the screenshots! The bigger animals are really well done, considering they're a bunch of triangles. The smaller animals are a bit weaker, and the birds' flying animations can be a bit awkward. Still, nothing too wrong!However, there's a big problem that comes from this.Hitboxes and limits are completely off.When you see a wall, it's a lie. The real wall is probably inside the rock, somewhere. It feels wrong to fly through part of the walls. Not sure why they didn't limit the levels properly (maybe to give it a sense of 3D?), but it didn't work for me, at all.There are some very big foreground objects.They cover up your vision and it's annoying.Alright, moving on to the music and sound-effects. One quick problem is that it doesn't save your volume options when you exit the game. So, if you need to balance the audio, feel free to do it every single time...Now, on to the actual topic. The music is a strange aspect of this game. The game is very nature and life inspired, so I was expecting some more folk-y music. Instead, it's a strange, more modern ambient music. I don't know. It doesn't really seem to fit, most of the time -- although, it certainly does fit when you meet the more complex structures. It makes the world feel a bit more alien, and the music certainly helps with that.The sound-effects, were almost spot-on! There's a huge contribution of the wild-life present in the game to the atmosphere. You'll be constantly listening to birds chirping, chittering from the rabbits, foxes, etc. When you're flying, the wind also intensifies. Overall, it all comes together and creates a very immersive atmosphere! It's impressive. Structure and MechanicsThis game is openworld and almost maze-like, at this. A cool thing that it does, though, is that the world is circular -- if you go right as much as you can, you'll eventually find yourself where you started. The downside is that it doesn't really serve as a handy shortcut, except in very specific circumstances. Still, it's a nice addition.Other than that, you have an hub area where there are several missing shards. Your main motivation is to find those shards, and see what happens.  When I said it's a light metroid-vania, was because you need to open up some areas and find your way around. Unfortunately, there isn't much in terms of power-progression. There is one power-up, but it's optional, and revealed itself incredibly useless -- its main possible advantages were actually disabled. What it ended up being was a very fun way of causing chaos. Fun for a few minutes, then it becomes just a mess.Anyway... The game has several gates, that require slivers to open. The shards just the same. These slivers are simply spread around to world, and you'll collect them by normally exploring -- in the best case scenario. The worst-case scenarios are game-breaking and I'll mention them later.Then, you can also collect other kinds of slivers -- blue ones. These work almost like Demon Souls' souls, in a very superficial way. If you collect X of them, you'll get a life. When you die, you'll lose a life, but respawn where you died. Otherwise, you'll drop the blue slivers you have, and go back to the Hub area. You can get those back. Their whole purpose is as lives, but the whole lives-system seems a bit directionless. The interesting thing, though, is how you collect these. There are eggs and nests spread around the world. If you drop an egg into a nest (without breaking it), a bird will be born, and drop a few of these blue slivers. Otherwise, you can also get it by reading runes spread throughout. These runes are written in english, but the characters are highly stylized, almost in code.You can collect these symbols (which are often well hidden) to be able to decode these messages easier. It's NOT needed, however. With a little effort, you can decode them yourself!I think this covers the basics.Stregnths and WeaknessesThe best aspect of this game, to me, is how alive it feels. Animals interact with each other, and also with you! Some are aggressive, some a more passive, but there's always some kind of interaction. You can also bait them into attacking into other, and even kill them, if they're making your life too difficult. Especially when you're carrying the shards, everything becomes attracted to you, and every animals steals your shard! You then have to run after them and get it back. I can imagine it being frustrating, but I found it really cool!Now, a mixed bag - the backstory. It's presented simply through the rune-stones. And these are strange and hard to read. They also have different writters. So, in a way, you get invested and interested in the world it presents. In another way, it's all done through such incoherent methods that it's very hard to follow. Maybe if you replay it, but otherwise... You're unlikely to retain most of it, which is really unfortunate.Also, you can't simply \"collect\" these runestones to read them later. If you want, you'll need to re-run through the whole areas separately. It's... too inconvenient, honestly. In regards to this, I think it's a very cool idea. However, it's too disjointed for me to enjoy it.Now, for the huge problems - physics.These feel so out of place. A lot of it is carrying or moving stones. Couple this with unclear hitboxes and what you get is yourself trapped between rocks and the wall. Off you go, then, altering the game's files to reset your position (the game could easily account for this with a reset button, but there isn't even that! It's a known issue, with half of the gamepad unused...).Then, you can carry vital items between zones. In the beginning of the game, it's easy to see one and try to bring it to the hub area -- didn't work, drop it somewhere. Later, you realize what it was for! Eureka! ... Well, where is it, now? Go around and around looking for it, praying that it's not behind foreground! It's very annoying, when you start.Then, the biggest problem. Slivers are exactly counted for you to finish the game. Not one too many. However: 1. They can spawn inside walls and be impossible to get without tweaking the files;2. Some gates consume more than they're supposed to;3. You can drop them easily (and lose them);4. Deaths can somehow lower your number -- this was my problem. It's a bug. One that had supposedly been fixed. Well, tough \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. I was 1 sliver short. One tiny shard of 100+. If all of these are KNOWN issues why couldn't they just add a few more for safety purposes? It's such an easy solutions... ConclusionI'm out of characters. BEWARE -- buy at your own risk! ",

        "text": "ContextSteam and Metal is a shoot 'em up/bullet-hell game, set in a Steampunk universe, with a Grieg-inspired soundtrack!This is a very good example of an amateur, yet very solid game! I was happy to play it, and it doesn't have too much that's wrong with it, which is surprising, as many people tend to ignore crucial details. This game does not. However, it doesn't add anything to the genre, and while it's a solid game, it pains me how similar it is to Jamestown! Not just in setting and general vibe, but also in the way it fills the screen with little cogs, and some other details. In the credits, the developer says the game has been slowly \"baked\" in 4 years, and looking at his youtube channel, there were prototypes as far back as 2010, so it doesn't seem to me like a rip-off. Perhaps it's just bad luck, but it's impossible to recommend this over Jamestown, since that adds a lot more to the genre, and is generally much bigger in scale and options.Regardless of that fact, I enjoyed playing this, and I'll review it by its own merits.PresentationThe visual style of this game reminds me a lot of an higher-res version of SNES games. The color-palette, especially, reminds of of A Link to the Past. It's colorful, but has a sort of low contrast, with more passive colors.Honestly, the game looks much better in motion that in the screenshots.The Boss visual design is also pretty cool. Won't blow your mind, but they're cool. There could be a bit more work into their details, but overall, I liked it.One problem people might have with it, is that it's very bare-bones. Levels have some motion to them, but not a lot. Not many details that I saw either. No particle or lighting effects or anything of the sort. It's very basic and somewhat static, but other than that, I think it looks really cool! Very clean looking.Now, the problems related to the visuals.First off, the bullets' colors are too varied. That's a bad thing, because it makes it harder to balance the backgrounds with the bullets, and you're very likely to get hit by something you didn't see. Related to this problem, is how the background has buildings which you never know if you'll get hit by or not. This makes dodging bullets a nightmare, and you're also trying to avoid everything. This is partially solved, with an option they introduced. You can \"mute\" and \"darken\" the backgrounds. This helps significantly with the backgrounds' distinction, but not a lot with the bullets. Especially when some bullets are very dark themselves.Also, explosions hide bullets a lot. It's really annoying, in harder levels.Other than these problems (which aren't too major, and the developer tried to give us options to deal with them), the visuals are fine. A bit too basic for some people, but they're well done!Now, on to the sound design!The sound-effects were a mixed bag. Some aspects I liked, others not so much. The positives outweigh the negatives, though.When you destroy enemies, they explode with a loud boom. A satisfying boom, I should say! They chose the sound well -- the downside is, when you destroy many enemies at once (there's a specific point in the game where this happens, otherwise it's totally fine) where the sounds just play exactly at once, which seems to up the volume a lot. The sound then gets overly loud and distorted. It's a very minor thing, but it happens everytime, so I thought I should mention it.The other problem, is the gun sounds. It sounds like you're shooting rubber bullets. (There are some Bomb enemies that \"pop\" when they die, a very toy-like sound that does not, in any way, sound like a bomb)I really like when the weapons sound like freakin' cannons (War Thunder and Blue Flamingo had spot on sounds for this!), and shooting rubber bullets sound a bit underwhelming. I'm aware that bullet sound often sound annoying when repeatedly shooting, and this was certainly a measure to solve that problem, but I'm not too keen on this \"solution\". Still, it's not too important -- just a minor gripe I had with it!Moving on to the music. As I said before, it was inspired by Grieg. You probably know In the Hall of the Mountain King, at least. Anyway, expect classical music! On the victory screens in sound almost like military march-music. I think it fits.And the music sounds good, certainly! Also some Final Fantasy touches here and there, although it's all orchestrated.The only problem I've had with it, is that it sounds a bit thin, and not very majestic. Just the way it was mixed, probably. Can't expect a real orchestra in a 5$ game, hehe! Still, it's very good, and this \"issue\" I have is completely fine for the scale of this game. Well done nonetheless!General Structure & MechanicsThere are 3 difficulty modes, and 6 levels. Each level has a Boss-fight at the end.The difficulty affects the damage you deal, that you take, and also some enemies' shooting patterns. The levels don't change significantly (aside from the same enemies being more powerful), but it's not a matter of \"more is harder!\". Every difficulty is available from the start.The levels start locked, and you need to unlock them by beating the previous one. I think this was slightly bugged. When you start Hard mode, you're also locking the Easy and Normal levels, strangely enough. Not a big problem, but hey, it's there.The mechanics are very simple. Your ship has a primary fire, and a secondary, more powerful weapon, instead of a Bomb. Your primary weapon has 3 states. It fires 1, 2 and then 3 bullets. You get cogs when you destroy enemies, which fills your weapon bar. I'm not sure if there are linear damage changes to the weapon, or whether it's a simple matter of being at different levels. The secondary weapon is a torpedo \"barrage\" -- this is too powerful of a word, though. You need to hold a button to charge it, and then launch them, doing significant damage. This plays a big part in the game's tactic, I believe. Knowing when to use them (as they're limited), and which enemies drop them is important to succeed, especially if you're not a very skilled player (*discreetly whistling*).Other than that, if have a health-bar and lives. When your life-bar depletes, you lose a life. There are periods of invincibility.Each level has a different theme, both visually, and in regards to enemies and hazards. If you're not good, you'll need to learn the levels before doing being able to beat the game all in one go.Enemy variety is surprisingly high! I wasn't expecting that at all. Usually, these indie games tend to make the most out of a few enemies and combinations. This game, however, introduces several enemies in each level, and they behave significantly different. It's quite impressive, honestly.The Boss fights are also really cool. They're all multi-phased, with patterns you'll need to learn. You usually have to destroy their weapons before going for the \"big kill\". It's good!ShortcomingsThere's only one ship. And it's a very basic one, without any interesting feature. It's unfortunate. In a game with such a rich enemy variety, one would expect more in terms of arsenal.As I've mentioned, there are some issues with the distinction between background and foreground -- it's dampenned, but not completely solved. And it caused me many deaths.The biggest thing of all, is that it doesn't bring anything new, really. It's a solid game, almost by-the-book. ConclusionThe setting, music... it's too similar to one of the best of the genre, and it's unfortunate, since it pales in comparison.Unless you want to play a more casual 'shmup, there isn't a big reason for you to try this.Otherwise, it's an honest game, and a very solid one at that!",

        "text": "ContextBloodrayne: Betrayal is a 2D action platformer. It has a very gothic setting and flashy combat, but is simpler than it would appear.This game is basically Castlevania meets Helsing meets Fleshgod Apocalypse. And personally, that freaking awesome! I'm a big fan of Castlevania (older ones), and this is as close to those as you can get. Plus, it has a great, modern soundtrack, in the same vein of Castlevania's.It's not Metroid-vania, though. Think NES Castlevanias, where you had a several levels through which you had to progress, with a few BossFights in the middle.When I first started, I was having a blast! However, the game doesn't add much in terms of weapon and enemy variety, and often suffered from misguided design in the later chapters. Regardless, it's certainly worth it, if you're into the genre!PresentationVisually, it's a strange game, quality-wise. In regards to style, I find it awesome! The characters have a bit of an anime style going for them, although it would have been cool to have gone a bit more into the over-the-top.Still, as I said, it reminds me a lot of Castlevania (you know, Vampires + lots of red) and Helsing. The combat style is a bit more Devil May Cry, only in 2D.AnimationThe character animations looks really good in combat, with some great distortion effects to simulate the blades' motions, but it looks a bit amateur when idle or just running. I'd put my finger on a certain lack of detail on those, ending up looking a bit bland. Still, you'll be fighting most of the time, and it looks great when doing so!EnvironmentsThe environments are mostly well designed, with a couple of exceptions. First, there are some textures that feel really out of place. It has a very detailed cartoon style, while the metal textures don't feel as polished. Not too bad.The other problem, is how some of the walls are deceptive, leaving you in doubt whether or not they're part of the background or the foreground. It cost me a few lives. Overall, I think this could be improved a decent amount.Filters and EffectsThis is mostly non-existant, with the exception of the last chapter. For some reason, they applied a red filter over the game, plus fire, on top of an already red game. The result is: you can't see \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Were that not enough, they also shake the screen constantly. I got some slight motion sickness because of that, and honestly, it didn't look very good. I understand what they were trying to do, but it wasn't necessary.Then, there are a few silhouette scenes spread throughout the game. These looks cool, but are completely unpractical, since you completely lose track of the animations (both yours and the enemies') and will often lose your character from sight. It's more of an annoyance than \"hey, it looks cool!\". They should have been tweaked with, but hey, not a major issue.FluidsThere's a lot of blood in this game. And a couple of other fluids. Instead of doing these in the same cartoony and stylish way as the rest of the game, they implemented some physics. They seem well done, but feel out of place, to me. I would have prefered to have seen the blood splashes drawn instead of Worms-like physics. Oh well. Again, it's a minor thing.Sound-effectsThey're mostly effective. The main character's scream when she dies is a bit annoying. But other than that, the combat slashes sound pretty good. I'm not sure how much of it is due to the sound-effects alone, but the combat is pretty visceral and feels good.MusicI was excited to get to this point. The music is absolutely amazing. Do you know Jake Kaufman? Shovel Knight, Contra 4, Retro City Rampage, etc.? If not, you should. He's certainly one of my favourite modern video-game composers, and I didn't expect this to come from him at all. Usually, he simulates the NES sounds (to be played on the actual hardware) and it sounds great! However, he composed a full Symphonic Metal soundtrack with a Classical vibe to it (Fleshgod Apocalypse, minus the vocals and over-the-top drumming). And yet, there's also an NES version of it that you can unlock in-game. It's awesome! It would fit Castlevania for sure, and it's something I'll be listening on my own!The music also changes its tone when you're near-death, providing good feedback.General Structure & Basic MechanicsThere are 15 Chapters/Levels in this game. There are 4 Boss fights spread out, although they seem to have been designed in pairs (almost upgraded versions of the other). I'm okay with that, since they still had significant differences.You start out with your Blade and a Gun, and later receive an additional Beam Laser. That's all, and it's unfortunate. It seems the kind of game that would have benefitted a lot from different weapons to keep the combat more engaging. Still, its was fun throughout!In each chapter, there are skulls to collect. These are often hard to see AND hard to reach. Every 5 you collect will earn you either an HP upgrade, an Ammo upgrade, of your choosing. I like that they've put these into the game, making me explore more than I would otherwise have. But, it has a significant problem, for me -- Many of them only give you one chance to get to them, unless you restart the level. The reason for that is that many require some creative platforming, often using carefuly placed enemies to do so. However, if you accidentally kill those enemies, they don't respawn, so \"bye-bye, skull\". The worst part of it is that you can easily kill those enemies before seeing the skull. It feels a bit cheap. Take into account that this problem is only significant if you want to get the achievement (or get most of the skulls because it's satisfying), and does not actually hurt the overall game.Enemy variety isn't great, but I think it's enough, for its length. There are several different enemies that require different approaches, and the encounter design usually has you face different combinations of them, so that's good!The game also features a ranking system for each level. I ranked miserably on all of them. Part of it was due to time, the other part due to getting hit. If you do like perfecting your playthroughs, you'll certain enjoy this game!Game Mechanics' IssuesPlatformingThis game is a very solid, stylish brawler. However, as I usually see, it tries to do challenging platforming, and ends up being far too frustrating and having serious control issues while at it. It's infuriating how many great game at doing X screw it up for unnecessarily trying (and failing) to Y.First off, the character is big. And that fine, for the combat! It gives better animation, and it's an overall upside! Not for tight platforming, however! Then, you can't cancel out of most moves. When the game tries to combine combat, platforming AND timed sections, it's a mess. Seriously, it's horrible.It has a particular enemy that's a rocket(?) that travels in a wave pattern. If it hits you, you get knocked back a lot. (Sounds familiar?) For the love of God, the times I fell down from platforms because of it... There are too many sections that require you to quickly jump to and from tiny platforms while those things randomly spawn, often impossible to dodge or hit... Chapter 13 in particular (I've written a full post on the Community Hub about it).It's really unfortunate. It has a similar system as Guacamelee, where your combat skill are also your platforming skills.ConclusionI hope that covers most of it, I was carried away -- hope that shows that I enjoyed it a lot!It has many serious issues, but it's still a very fun game, and one that I didn't expect to enjoy as much! But I'm biased, since I love the genre and style of it.If you like the NES Castlevanias, definitely give this one a go!",

        "text": "ContextA Bird's Story is the first game we see from Kan Gao after his previous success, To the Moon. It has a few similarities, but it's a very different game at its core.This is a short game, once again focusing on narrative, but trying a few different techniques, far from what we've seen in TtM! This is a wordless story, and it reminds me a lot of old Disney movies, where the sound plays a big part, exaggerating motion in a very whimsical way!This review will not contain heavy spoilers, but my own interpretation will be mentioned. If you want to experience the game completely blind, don't read this; I'll not spoil any of the plot, though.Interaction is very limited, although present in some key moments. This is NOT To the Moon. It's not supposed to, so know what you're getting into!It's easy to come into it expecting something different after being exposed only to the previous game. So here's my advice to you: go to the Freebird's website, and try out Do you Remember my Lullaby?. Then, you can feel free to try the other ones. I personally believe that this gives you a lot more understand of what Kan Gao is trying to do with his games in general. And I'm sure you'll be able to connect better if you have opened your mind a bit more!Also, an interesting aspect is what influenced him and his games. If you know the works of Pixar, Hayao Miyazaki and Makoto Shinkai, you can safely take something out of this. It's not exactly the same, but it comes from a similar place!Alright, enough with this -- onwards with the review.PresentationThis is an RPGMaker game, once again, and it carries the engine's problems with it. Other than that, though, it's a really good RPGMaker game! The graphics are very similar to his previous games in terms of resources, but the scenes are arranged in a very unique way.Everything feels like a memoryYou know how memories work. Many of the people are mere faceless figurines, disjointed scenes leading up to the important moments... This is basically A Bird's Story. I find this an awesome aspect of how the game is presented! The world isn't fixed, so to speak, but every scene flows into the other seamlessly, but also disjointedly, as if in a memory.Irrelevant details are obscured, instead giving the spotlight to the important actors and emotions. It worked perfectly to me, and it's a nice little way of doing story-telling!I have a problem regarding how the game guides the player, but I'll write about it in the Gameplay section, since it's almost the only meaningful \"mechanic\" worth mentioning.The music and sound-effects, as expected, are beautiful. If you've played his other games, you know what to expect! Great piano pieces in the background, often giving place to more \"movie-esque\" tracks with a silly or careful vibe. The biggest similarity I find with Disney movies comes from here exactly.The sound effects often reinforce the character's gesturesIf you know old Disney cartoons, you know what I'm talking about. There was no dialogue, so everything was basically sound-effects. With characters running, hiding, jumping, everything was complemented by some silly sound-effects. A Bird's Story gave me the exact same feeling, and that's great!The music also calms when you move away from certain scenes, and does so very subtly. Sound design is spot-on, in my opinion!I'd like to add how big the attention to detail is. From the small sprite expressions to their movements, everything seems to have been taken into account. The sprites are pretty small, so a simple way is needed to convey that emotion, and that's certainly achieved. The world is also colored by the character's view of those scenes. There was a particular moment where he saw/remember the world as dangerous and toxic because of the mindset he was in. It's hard to explain without spoiling certain moments, so I'll leave it at that.There's also quite a bit of character development, always told through little details. A blanket, an umbrella and even a sneeze provided some particularly nice moments, in my experience.This is a story. It's almost a short movie told through RPGMaker. And for that, it's really good, albeit \"simpler\" in the mechanics' department.General Structure & GameplayI believe the game has several scenes from which you can start if you decide to leave. I have played it all in one sitting, and so should you! It should take you less than 90 minutes, so it shouldn't be too hard. As I said before, the interaction factor is very small. Mostly you can just walk around, occasionally interacting with one object or another, while always limited. There is barely any filler interaction. What I mean by that is interacting with objects not relevant to the story. You won't examine a fridge or a closet unless there's something there that you need to progress. That might be a bit frustrating, as used to shooting every monitor/glass we see in most games, but there's a reason for that, in this game!Aside from walking around and fetching a couple of objects (always close together), what you can do is a very specific action to the scene. Many people thought that these moments fell short of expectations; if you connect with the character, however, you'll probably find them very important! And that's what this game is about -- indentifying with certain traits of the boy and playing along to find how the story progresses.It may not be your cup of tea at all.Artificial and hand-holdy use of icons and guidanceThe biggest problem is how the game guides the player, and how it often switches between interaction and cutscene moments without fully conveying the change. It also overuses sparkles and arrows to tell you where to go or examine. It feels very artificial in an otherwise immersive game with great, great details. It seems to have been overlooked a bit too much and I believe it hurts the game experience.I think I've said most of what I wanted.There are just a couple of things. First, I didn't find the pacing to fit me very well. Somehow, there were a few moments that seemed to drag on. I can't pinpoint them, unfortunately, but sometimes it just didn't feel right.On the upside, this game might be one of the games I've played with the most memorable scenes \"per minute\". There's a lot to look at, in here. Many details, some references to other games, some are just some quirky and cheesy scenes. But outside of those, there are some truly nice moments, especially when you see different reaction to similar situations (and you understand exactly why!).Closing ThoughtsI think it's really good. However, it's a slice-of-life theme that we're not used to, in videogames. As such, many people will not connect with it at all, while others will find it hard to see elements from animated movies/cartoons integrated into an RPGMaker game.Regardless, there's a lot more to look at than it seems, at first. I really enjoyed it, both the story and the awesome music, and it also made me search a bit more about Kan Gao, and he's certainly someone that I certainly do look up to, as an artist.If you enjoy narrative, experimental games, give this one a go, and then check out his other works!",

        "text": "Serious Sam: The Random Encounter is a mash-up of Serious Sam, old-school JRPGs (say, Final Fantasy) and, unexpectedly enough, a bullet-hell shooter. Yes, it is definitely all of those things!ContextJust a little bit of history, this was part of a series of promotional Serious Sam games, created by Devolver Digital to promote the (at the time) upcoming Serious Sam 3.The other game of the series I've played, was a 2D side-scrolling shooter, where you could mount guns on top of other guns, and had massive mobs of enemies exploding around you. It was a blast!With that said, when I saw this available on a sale, I decided to give it a go, as ridiculous as the premise sounds!It's a byte-sized game made by Vlambeer, so you know what to expect, knowing them -- sometimes unfair, yet really fun and chaotic arcade gaming!PresentationThe visual style in this game immediately shows what the game is. It features the indentifiable Vlambeer style, with the whole SS crew of headless guys with bombs for hands and lava monters! I'm not too familiar with the Serious Sam games (I own them, just haven't gotten around to playing them), so I can't say how faithful it may be.Regardless, it looks pretty cool. It's a retro looking and sounding game, but not in a lazy way.You'll literally fight dozens of enemies at once, in each battle, all with a big flare of explosions and bullet flying around. You may argue that it sometimes obfuscates the screen and isn't very clean -- but honestly, that's not the point. It's supposed to be silly, mindless and over-the-top, and that's exactly what it is! In a good way.Each area has a very characteristic look, and it's really great to see hordes of enemies on screen getting obliterated.The music is a bit strange. I can't tell if it's a different and more retro arrangement of SS's music. Regardless I think it's pretty good! Some of it (especially the drumming) sounds like MIDI, and the rest is simply synth based music. It does fit the theme, though! Futuristic levels sound futuristic, egypt level sounds oriental, that sort of stuff. I really enjoyed the music while I played the game!In the way of options and interface, it's a bit limited, but it doesn't really matter very much. I beat the game in less than 2 hours, so there weren't any major problems that I've found worth mentioning.The writing isn't at all serious, being very self aware and constantly poking fun at both SS and JRPG tropes. It was amusing to me, taking the context of the game into account.General StructureIn this game, you have 3 different levels, each with 3 different stages. It plays like a JRPG. You have a topdown view and a small map, sometimes with \"puzzles\" to solve. I say \"puzzles\" but I don't think they count as that. It's more the concept of puzzle that the game uses to poke fun at. Go to A, press switch, door opens -- with guts and explosion in the middle.In these maps, there are, as the name suggests, random encounters!Yes, about every 2 steps. Literally. Don't worry, the maps aren't all that big. At the end of each battle, your characters gain a bit of armor, if they didn't get hit, so it definitely rewards \"decent\" play -- skill isn't a big factor in this game, no worries!You'll have to balance exploration (very minimal, each stage fits easily in one screen) and just rushing to the end. Why? Because there are chests spread around the stages. These chests contain weapons and items that will certainly prove useful. On the downside, you'll have more encounters, which is more dangerous.At the end of each level there's a Boss fight, which mainly involves a big horde plus a really big unique monster.Death is punished, buy it's not too punishing by any stretch. I find it completely fair! You have 3 lives. If you die in any encounter, you'll go back one step behind that encounter, and lose a life. If you lose all your lives, you simply restart the stage. Since the stages are really short, it's never a problem.You start with only one character, but then pick another 2, on later levels.General Mechanics and Combat SystemOk, this is the interesting part of the game, of course! How exactly do they combine JRPG combat with bullet-hells?Well, honestly, not very well, from a design standpoint. It is, however, a fun idea to experiment in a game like this!Basically, it's a turn-based bullet-hell game. The game stops every 5 seconds. When it stops, you get to choose an action. Use an item? Change weapon? Or maybe you'll simply attack. When you attack or change weapon, you'll chosen which direction you'll want to shoot, and that's about it.While it's really simply, conceptually, it has many more ideas thrown in, which I'll talk ahead, regarding weapons. (1)Outside the turn, you basicaly move vertically, trying to shoot your enemies, and dodge bullets (which is worth mentioning by itself (2)). The items aren't very interesting, although they certainly are useful. There are items that heal the party, give them full armor, 4x damage, speed, huge bombs, etc. Nothing very unique, but I'm glad they're there regardless! It adds variety and some degree of tactic to the combat.I think that's enough to give you a general idea of what the game is. Now, I'd like to discuss some aspects that may make-or-end the deal, for you.1.WeaponsFirst off, I'll write about the weapons, since I think it's the coolest aspect of the game. There are several different weapons. And when I say different, I mean different! Not just more powerful, faster, bigger -- they actually feel different, and have mechanics of their own, playing with the turn-based side of the game.For example, there's a Revolver that is a bit weak, but auto-targets close targets, killing them one by one. There's a  Shotgun that shoots only in a certain range that you assign to it when you choose your turn-action -- Trading individual damage for less, spread damage.There's a big Cannon that is piercing and very large shot, basically killing everything in front of it (or the direction you choose) -- however, you always have to wait for a turn for it to recharge! And using items doesn't count.Then, there's a Grenade Launcher and damage a radial area of your choosing.I could go on, but this gets the point across. The weapons are really different from one another, and it adds quite a lot to the combat! It also adds interesting aspects to the weird, unique concept of this game.2. Dodging enemies and bullets with 3 charactersI've talked about my favourite aspect; now it's time for by biggest problem!The game is very unbalanced. Period. There was certainly some thought put into it, since the game is beatable for sure, and item placement helps with that. However, this is a very byte-sized game, and such a thing wouldn't work on a bigger game. But I'm digressing.The point is, when you're in battle, it's almost impossible to dodge enemies and bullets. Your only defense is actually a brutal offense. If you can kill everything before it gets to you, you're in a good spot! Otherwise, you're screwed.I mean, there are 3 characters, with a decent space between them. So, if you want to dodge, you'll have to dodge with all three at once. Besides, with the amount of enemies that there are, you'll often be overwhelmed, at one point or another. It happens a lot, but you can be more prepared on your next try.ConclusionThe game doesn't require a lot of skill, directly because of this. It's a mindless game about slaughtering hordes of enemies at once, with big guns. Still, it's chaotic and fun! If you want a short, little, but mechanically ball-sy game, look no further! It's not perfect, but it has its moments!",

        "text": "ContextGEARCRACK Arena is a top-down shooter/melee combat game (similar to Hotline Miami), in which you try to beat 9 different waves in an arena-style match. It's also, often, the cheapest the game on Steam! That is more or less justified, seeing that this was a product of a 72-hour game jam.However, the game also gets a lot of flak based on the circle-jerk formed around these cheap, low-budget games. While some of it is understandable, the game being very barebones and limited, it's also more of a product of the community rather than the game. At its core, it's actually a fun game to play, as long as you see it as an experiment or proof of concept. For some reason, people play 19 cents for it, pay it with trading cards, and expect this to be a fully featured game.PresentationThis is a very dirty, cyberpunk inspired game, and it's done pretty well! The tutorial is done with a long text written on the floor at an angle, which is mostly hard to read and annoying. It's also very simplistic. With that in mind, and people already in a negative state-of-mind, it's easy to overlook the rest. Also, it looks much better moving than in still pictures, like the screenshots.The explosions, for example, look really awesome! For some reason, I really like just looking at them. Visual related problems include, for example, the way that your character easily blends with the background, both being similarly black. You can see your head easily, but not the weapon, making hitting enemies a bit harder than it could be.Also, explosions are much larger than your character, easily engulfing you in flames. Dead enemies (with persistent explosions) are still a solid object, so it may lead to some confusion, when you lose sight of your character. However, it also makes it harder for enemies to hit you, which is a good strategy for you to use!I also think that the interface could be different. The blackground is mostly black/dark-grey, while the ammo indicator is on a far corner, and is also grey. You can't really use peripheral vision to check it, requiring you to look there and not the actual game. It's not significant at all to this game, specifically, but good to note regardless, I think. The way it portrays information could be clearer than it is.The sound-effects I have nothing against, nor in favor. They're effective, I guess.The music, however, is where it shines, and something that highly contributes to the atmosphere. It's mostly industrial metal, sometimes going a bit overboard to the electronic influences, but it's pretty good. It's fairly simple music, and problably something I wouldn't listen to on my free time; in the context of the game, though, I really enjoyed it!Furthermore, by buying this game, you also get the soundtrack in your folder!General Structure and MechanicsIn this game, you basically fight your way through 9 waves. There's only one enemy type, with each wave having more enemies than the previous one. There are 5 characters, each with a slight change in stats. Each has a few ranks, increasing their stats, but just a little bit, and you can level them up all the way in a couple of minutes -- based on how far you reach, I believe, but there could be some experience system involved. The only problem with the characters, is that they all feel and play basically the same. The different is in the amount of Hacks, Ammo or Armor you have, which doesn't make a very significant difference. There's one character, however, that has slightly lower armor, but moves faster, being the one that changes the gameplay a bit more.The game has a great degree of randomness involved. From the enemy's movement pattern to your own attributes, everything seems to have random as its source of dynamic. I'll talk more about it later, though. Here are the attributes you have:Armor - This determines the chance you have to die, when you're hit. Each time you're hit, you have a chance to die. Not a health-bar, or lives. It's chance. That chance, however, is lower the more armor you have. This... is not a very good way of doing things but again, I'll talk about it later.Ammo - There's a cyberpunk name for it, but let's just call it ammo! You have a gun, but it has very little ammo. Usually 2-3 shots, some characters having 4-5. To use them you have to aim it first, lowering your speed a lot. It's also quite hard to hit, since enemies have some unpredictable movement, and you have to hit them in the center. The weapon is piercing, so you can kill several enemies with one bullet.Hacking - This is the main ability in the game. When you press Space, enemies will be unable to shoot for a few second. Not every enemy, though. Some resist it -- and if they do once, they'll always do. It changes thinks quite a lot, actually! You'll have to decide which enemies to shoot first, and when to use your Hack ability. The number you can use is limited, but it's also random. Each time you use it, there's a chance that it will malfunction, that being the last time you use it. The higher your stat, the lower chance for that to happen!Both hacking and ammo replenish after each wave.That's basically it. Every enemies dies in a single hit. You can either shoot them, which is also, but has good range, or you can use your Bat. It's a bit weird to use the bat, due to the very similar color as the background; it also has a weird timing. When you Left-click, your character spins with the bat.For what it is, the gameplay is surprisingly dynamic. You'll have to give it a few tries before you find a viable strategy. You have to avoid as much as possible to get hit, since there's a chance that it will kill you. You can also try different timings for hacking, going first for disabled (or not) enemies, and even trying to kill enemies in a close area, giving you some cover, while you shoot the others down.Now, to the main points I want to criticize.Randomness As I mentioned, there's too much of it involved. From the enemy movement to your death and hacking chances. It makes the game quite unreliable; while it is not a particularly big problem in such a small game as this, I highly doubt it would work in a bigger game.Random is an easy way of making each experience difference, but there's a fine balance between doing that and going completely overboard with it. In a different iteration, it would be cool to see some items to serve as a reward and actually change gameplay -- maybe a bullet-deflecting sword, a dash, maybe a teleport, etc. etc. The possibilities are quite wide. And, of course, more enemies.As it is, the game feels random for the sake of it. There's no real benefit to it, as it's not a core mechanic.Enemies always shoot when the game starts - Unavoidable damageAfter the first move, you can dance around to avoid shots. However, as soon as the wave starts, they shoot you, and hit you, as shots are really fast. This is a big problem, as a result of each shot being a potential death.I've had several runs ended because of that. Each run shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, but still... It's definitely not a satisfying death, especially if you're doing well.ConclusionThis is probably the biggest issue for anyone who buys the game. In all honesty, there isn't a whole lot to it. I believe it should be a free game, for sure. However, consider you're paying for the soundtrack. In a sale, I'd say it's worth it, especially since it often is (at 19 cents), which you can easily cover with selling the 3 cards it brings. There being only one enemy type, and every class being too similar, you'll probably take little out of it. BUT it's not nearly as bad as people claim, so give it a go!",

        "text": "ContextYury is an old-school inspired shooter-platformer, trying to be faithful to the old days by having hard as nails difficulty.While it has some aspects that are quite nice, most of the game falls into very obvious design flaws, coupled with very significant programming bugs and inconsistent systems.It's unfortunate, since most of the problems could be easily fixed, and made the game somewhat worthwhile, instead of the unfair and frustrating experience that it is at the moment.The game can be completed in about 20 minutes, but I doubt anyone here will manage that the first time! I've taken four hours to beat it, while taking notes and trying to figure out exactly what was wrong in some sections.PresentationVisually, it's very simple looking, with backgroundsonly have 3-4 frames of animation, but aside from the limitations, I found it pretty decent. The pink/purple-ish color reminded a lot of the game Bleed, actually.There are only a couple of enemy designs, but they look pretty good. While there isn't a lot of environment decoration in the game, with the vegetation being very sparse, I thought it looked pretty cool.However, there's one big flaw right of the bat:Deliberate obstruction of the game's viewFor some reason, the developer thought it would be great to have foregroud elements hidding enemies and platforms. It's frustrating and is just there to piss players off. There is a lot of unpredictability in this game, which is a very artificial way of creating difficulty, in the way Yury does it.The sound-effects are functional, not much to say about it.The music, however, was pretty good! It fit the old-school vibe, and seemed generally well made.Structure & Basic MechanicsThe game has essentially 2 parts. During the first, you have no gun, making it a pure platformer. There are enemies, making you do some very, very unforgiving dodges, and even take advantage of the game's flaws to beat a certain section.During the second half, the platforming is less relevant (while still very unfair), and the game decides to throw tons and tons of enemies at you. They mostly die in 1 hit. However, there can only be 3 shots in the screen at once. This could be a throwback to the old days, but it feels out of place, here. It also has a very inconsistent rate-of-fire as a result, leading to many deaths, when you're expecting to shoot a fraction of a second earlier, and missing as a result.Every enemy kills you instantly when it touches you. Yep, a very minor touch, in a completely harmless body part kills you. They also have a tendency to get stuck in the terrain, unfreeing themselves in the most inopportune moments, often leading to impossible-to-avoid deaths.There's one Boss fight with a pretty cool sequence, despite a bit frustating due to huge flaws in the controls.The game as several hazards for you to avoid.Spikes don't actually kill you, but damage your suit, making you lose oxygen. The less oxygen you have, the less you'll be able to jump. If you run out, you die. This makes death take a long time, while adding nothing to the game. Also, some spikes don't damage you. Arbitrarily so! The game loves to be inconsistent, leading to many unfair sections that simply lead to frustration.Now, back to the suit/oxygen mechanic. It could be nice! The game uses it in one instance, where you need to get damage in order to quickly get to a checkpoint. However, it's never used again! The game has a couple of nice, unique mechanics, that it decides not to use more than once... Lava doesn't kill you instantly, but close. It highly increases your suit's temperature. If it gets too high, you die. This could've have been cool, once again. If you fall, you can quickly jump you into a platform and survive. However, it's only used 2 or 3 times to the game's favour. Again, a unique mechanic that's barely used.Then, there are a variety of platforms. Timed platforms, moving platforms, dodging platforms, etc. etc. There's a huge problem with moving platforms. I'm assuming the developers didn't know how to program it properly, and so, if you fall of a moving platform, your character will keep moving in that direction, even if you fall into the ground... or flying... it makes it impossible to successfuly land, if you slip -- your character will simply be bugged and moving without command.Another big problem is how platforms are desynchronized. You'll often have to wait more than you should for the platforms to get in sync again. The checkpoint are also mind-blowingly bad, choosing the worst timing possible -- leading to seconds of waiting for platforms, and sometimes even blind waiting.ControlsOk, this is an enormous topic, in this game. The controls are awful, for many reasons.1.Default Unity Capsule hitboxRemember how old-school games had a capsule as a hitbox, getting you constantly stuck or slip at the edge of platforms? Right, me neither. Because it's not a good way of doing things.I don't understand how this made it into the final game... A capsule player character might be useful in many situations, but not in a precision platformer, come on! Seriously, whenever you land slightly to the side of a platform, the rounded edge of the character (completely unrelated to the sprite, of course) will get you slowly sliding down, impossible to control... leading to dozens and dozens of deaths. This happens throughout the whole game. The hit-detection is completely broken as a result.2.Slippery movement I'm assumming your character doesn't stop moving until the animation ends. So guess what -- you'll let the button go, but your character will keep moving for a bit, reaching the edge of a platform, and consequently fall because of the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hitbox! Yay...3.Unsafe platformsYou know what's good after a dangerous jump? Being on top of a platform, finally feeling safe, and getting ready for the next jump. In Yury, however, platforms often run into spikes or into the ceiling, ending up throwing you off. Enemies also have a tendency of getting under platforms (or above), barely touching you, but killing you nonetheless....So far, this review is really negative. Well, two more...Impossible to see ahead - Trial an' Error & Unpredictable DeathsThe game often has you do leaps of faith. Yep, there's a big pit in front of you -- Jump! Then, you miss a platform that was somewhere in the middle, leading to a death. There are also enemies hidden in the foreground. There are enemies that very quickly rush at you from the top of the screen between platforms (where you need to jump)... There's too much of that.Badly placed platformsDo you know the first Super Mario level? That one where everything is calculated to teach the player when the jump, the mushroom mechanics and jumping on enemies? That's really good level design! This game does the exact opposite. Platforms are deliberately placed to making you touch the edge of one (hidden in the foreground, of course), then screwing up your timing -- leading to a death. Making you fall into lava, and then placing a platform above you, making it impossible to get back to the ground safely... There's too much of this infuriating design in Yury. Everything is unfair and controls badly -- then trying to pass as \"old-school hard game\" which it is definitely not. This game is pure trial an' error.It's very unfortunate, because aside from that, the level design is varied, and the game has some nice sections! If it wasn't ruined by poor placement and controls, it could have been pretty good!When you have a game where a simple jump to a platform is hard, you have a problem. They've built a game around bad mechanics, and it resulted in a bad game, obviously.",

        "text": "Koya Rift is a 2D Action Platformer, with a big emphasis on random generation of both maps and weapons, as well as a scaling difficulty.While it has its heart on the right place, and does everything it says (on paper),  its methods don't prove as effective.The main problem here is that all the random generation alters stats and numbers, but everything feels the same.PresentationFor the game's scope, I think it looks and sounds pretty good! Especially since it was made by only one person, and a musician. It won't blow your mind, but it's really solid.It's simple looking, but each weapon has a different color, creating some pretty great light effects. The fact that it's not low-res helps it quite a lot to stand out as well.The enemy design is my favourite part. While there's effectively only one design (with some changes between each type), it gives the game a lot of personality.The player character, allies and turrets also look pretty cool. It's more modern that you would expect from an indie game.The only problem with it is that, when there are many enemies and allies close to you, all shooting at each other at once, the game gets a bit frame-y, and the explosion obfuscate everything else. Your best bet is to just stand back, otherwise you'll be hit by a lot of hidden bullets.Everything is also color-coded. From the enemies to the weapons, its color will determine its effects, like piercing, explosive-damage, life-steal, etc. This leads to the next aspect: interface.The interface is simple and functional, I like it. However, the loading screens and the way it teaches you these mechanics is a bit of a problem, to me.During the loading screens, you're presented with leaflet-esque presentations with the colors, story or enemies explained. While they're pretty neat, visually, it's still a screen with paragraphs of text, which is definitely not ideal to teach a game's mechanics. Regardless, I don't think it plays a huge part in actually playing it, and you'll learn what you need in the first battles.The sound-effects were pretty standard, nothing noteworthy. Still, whenever an enemy died or you destroyed a crystal, a sound played, giving you good feedback.The music wasn't bad at all, although it was a bit... generic, I guess. The musicians is clearly talented, so it would have been nice to have something a bit more unique. Also, it doesn't loop very well, and it's pretty short, so you're very likely to hear the wrong looping every level.Structure & Mechanics' OverviewThere are two modes: Battle and Campaign. The campaign is basically progressively more difficult battles, with a progression system added to it. The battles lose a lot for not having any progression. They take 5-10 minutes at most, so it's not like a Binding of Isaac, where there's progression in each battle. Not at all. You can pick a few power-ups, buy a few droids, but it's almost meaningless, since they're so short.However, these battles serve two purposes: as a tutorial, and difficulty measurement. Before you unlock the campaign, you'll have to play a few battles, first. This is basically to teach you the general mechanics before jumping into it. Aside from that, it's seeing how well you do, and deciding the campaign's starting difficulty.I've done more battles than necessary, and finished the campaign 2 or 3 times, so you can see that it's very short.Let's now talk about the weapons. As I've mentioned, there are specialized effects that are color coded. These will basically determine what weapons you'll want to carry with you, for the different situations. Usually, I took one with slowing, one with life-steal, and one with explosive-damage. But there are some other choices, that I won't detail.Aside from these effects, and during the campaign, there are also attributes.These include rate of fire, size, accuracy, and homing. There are 4 or 5 ranks to each, and the price for the upgrades increase the more you buy.You'll also be able to pick weapons in power-up form, that you can switch between, and also upgrade. These have a decent variety, because of the stats and effects combinations. However, the game has a tendency to overwhelm you with these. By the end, you can have 10+ weapons that you have no use for (1).The enemies also have different weapons, with these characteristics. Also, some are faster, some are more deadly, tankier, etc. Visually, they have a similar base design (with differences in size and form), but you can generally distinguish well between them. In each battle, you start at your base, and then have to go underground to destroy every crystal and enemy. Your base, if not under attack, will heal you, and restore your energy. Energy depletes when you shoot.You can also buy Droids and Turrets, in the base. These rank up, becoming more powerful as they kill enemies. Turrets are stationary, and just for base defense. Droids can go with you, or stay defending the base.Droids are basic units that will follow you around and shoot everything they see. They'll also be in front of your character, tanking the damage.If your character dies, you'll have to control a droid, and go underground to the place you died, and ressurect. You'll ressurect  with as much energy and HP as you had (or, well, very little). This plays an important part about difficulty, which I'll talk about later (2).There's a bit issue with these droids, which is their path-finding. The maps are randomly generated in squares, with lots of intersections. Your allies VERY easily get stuck in those, and you'll have to manually do a dance to get them out. If you don't, they'll simply be reset back to base. This is really annoying. In some levels, as you'll have to constantly go back and forth...The power-ups are quite varied to. They include shields (for you or your minions), helper weapons, ranks, energy, etc. There's one particular power-up that's awesome: it's gives you the ability to basically phase through the walls, slowly losing HP. This lets you go around enemies, escape more easily, etc., giving you more strategical choice. Unfortunately, there aren't that many situations where you can use it appropriately, and it's the only power-up with a cool ability.I think this is enough. Now, to talk about the 2 major points about this game, for me.1.WeaponsThey are indeed randomly generated, but there's one big problem: they all feel exactly the same. There isn't any mechanical quirk to any of the weapons, and every element is merely numerical. Faster rate, more damage, spread shot, etc. It's unfortunate. However, if they actually felt different (in a different game, I guess) it would be much more interesting. Perhaps an overheating laser, or a manually reloaded Shotgun, etc. Then, each type of weapon could have its own stats and progression. Just my 2 cents. In the end, they all feel the same weapon, in this game, which defeats the point of random generation, a bit. 2. DifficultyWhile the procedural generation does what it promises, the game is still far too easy. I didn't have any issues, with the exception of the last campaign level, and because of a very specific reason. It's basically a big room with lots of huge enemies. If you die, you'll fall to the bottom. And then, getting yourself out is a pain in the ass, because you're bombarded from every direction...Aside from that, it's too easy, and you just need to be careful, with certain enemies.ConclusionThis review may sound overly negative, but being critical doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the game! It's actually pretty good, for what it is. Sure, it's limited and byte-sized, but it's a fun experiment, for a couple of hours. Recommended on a sale!",

        "text": "//N.P.P.D. RUSH//- The milk of Ultraviolet is a very, very weird game! It's mostly a top-down shooter of sorts, with some light rogue-like and bullet-hell elements. It's a game that you can pretty much beat in less than 10 minutes, but it may take a couple of hours to understand what's going on and be able to beat it.Basically, you're dying. You've been in some sort of accident, lost your limbs, and are now attached to a motorcycle, with guns for arms. Badass, huh? Everything has a decayed, drugged feel, in a good way. Your task is to collect girls for an unknown purpose (later revealed), and try to survive while you're at it.You kill enemies that drop money, and you can use that money to upgrade, sell your organs (and be left bleeding out), buy girls, buy more time, etc. Have I mentioned it's a crazy game?ContextAfter Uriel's Chasm, Rail Slave Games seems to have become the developers whose games people just get for very cheap, and then do joke reviews on. While there are many legitimate flaws in this game, it certainly does not deserve the way people look at it as. I played his other game yesterday, and while I recommended it for people who owned it, and wanted a completely crazy experience, I do not think it is a very good game, even at its core. The cryptic biblical theme didn't help either.With this game, however, while it's full of huge flaws, design-wise, it's also something very unique at its core, and I actually enjoyed it! Think dark Hotline Miami, on steroids. This is pretty much that, although in a smaller scale.I've bought it for less than 40 cents, and it gives you 3 cards, which you can sell for 9 cents each, so half of the game pays for itself. PresentationAlike their other game, there are steam reviewers saying the game's  retro look is badly done and very ugly.Well, the ugliness is completely intentional, and it gives the game a very personal vibe, in my opinion. It's a weird mixture of glitch and cyberpunk. It's gritty and cheesy, but it definitely sets the tone and carries the experience almost by itself.Mind, however, that the game has many faults when it comes to feedback, and part of it comes in visual form. This is because you get blood on your screen when you kill enemies (the one introduced after release doesn't, due to a bug...). This would look like you're the one being damaged. However, when you're damaged, the screen gets blue, and can often pass unnoticed. It's ... not good. You'll often die because you didn't realize how close you were to death. It's unfortunate...Thematically, it's very cool looking!The sound-effects aren't very high quality, but again, help to set the tone. Didn't find them very good at all, but hey...The music is also a mixed bad. It's mostly an amateur industrial metal. It's very noisy and low-fi, and I'll definitely not listen to it on my own time. Yet, it adds a lot to the experience. Most people will find it completely awful at first listen... the whole game feels like that. But if you can put yourself in the right mindset, you'll find that it's a very cohesive experience, design-wise, and thus creates a great atmosphere to visit for a short while.Interface and Options-wise, it's pretty horrible. Besides, half of the things do not exactly work as intended. Your preferences always reset when you get to the menu (either by starting the game, or finishing a run), the timer starts counting on the menu rather than when you start a run, etc. Still, the most important option for me was the game's volume (no separate sliders either), and that could be changed at any time, by pressing \"+\" and \"-\", so that's fine. You always have to click when the cursor is on \"back\" to go back. Many people, myself included, simply press \"Esc\" to go back, and that closes the game immediately. There isn't any sort of saving, so you may lose a few runs by mistake like that. Most of the dreadful first impression comes from this. The developer has said that he doesn't like making options menus and the like and wants to express himself. I can understand that, but the result is a game that seems to have be hammered together. And, for most people, it's definitely a big wall to their enjoyment, leading the the whole joke circle jerk around the developer.The game didn't feature any menu, initially, but it was updated after release to have some options. It was appreciated, but it explains many of the bugs. The menu exists, but the game hasn't been changed to accomodate it...Bottomline is, it's probably the game with the roughest edges I've played. The interfacing is absolutely awful, and the presentation very unpolished. Still, if you can get past that, you may enjoy yourself!Structure & MechanicsIn this game, you need to save 30 girls, spread through 5 floors. After that, a passage on the 5th floors opens up, leading you to the final Bossfight.It's a simple twin-stick shooter. You move with WASD, and aim/shoot with the mouse. The menus are the same.I don't know why people mention the controls as being bad. I thought they were fairly good. Sure, it does not have gamepad support, but it's no the end of the world. Perhaps people didn't notice that you're on a motorcycle, so you move as in such. It felt pretty good, to me!Besides, your guns have a very high rate of fire, and make the enemies seems like butter, at times.The camera is also very close to your character, which may hinder gameplay for most people. Honestly, I was waaay past that when I played this game. It's the kind of thing you can play for 10 minutes, be challenged, and then put it down.Each floor has a different configuration, and you'll have to learn their layout to plan accordingly. You have a time limit (which you can increase with money), so it's important to know where to go. The levels are also full of enemies, some of which have a very bullet-hellish pattern. There are only 3 enemy types, though. There's a shop in the begining of the level, and it's also your \"staircase\" to change floor. In the shop, you can buy one weapon upgrade, time, girls, and then there are 2 things with a heavy penalty to them. One, is buying health, but losing time. The other, selling your organs, for a big amount of money. Time doesn't tick when you're in the shop. However, once you sell an organ, your health starts to decrease, as you're bleeding out. While the intention would be for the game to have a very subtle balance between what the player buys, it can be cheesed (haha, obviously!). While that may seem a bad thing (and yes, it is bad design), it opened up a speed-run competition on the Hub, where people are trying to cheese the game faster. It's amusing.When I first beat the game, I beat it normally, by using the shop only to buy the weapon and time. I explored the levels thoroughly, and collected the girls. It took me more than an hour to understand what was really going on, haha! After that, I cheesed the game, and half cheesed it a couple of more times. It was fun. The last Boss is in a small screen, with bullet-hell patterns. It only has one phase, and there are situations where you can't avoid to take damage. Still, I never died against it, and I'm not particularly good at these games... The Boss fight is also independent on the rest of the game, so no need to worry about health or anything else.ConclusionThe game is very, very imperfect, and really bad at times. However, if you manage to ignore that, and even the sub-par design, you'll be left with a very unique experience, and quite fun at its core, I've found! I won't play any more than these 2 hours, but it was almost free... Besides, if you're into getting into the highest scores, the game is quite fun to play with.For the vibe alone, recommended! Otherwise.. don't.",

There are completely arbitrary \"Full Motion Video\" cutscenes, but let's ignore those, shall we? I think that, designed as a retro game, it looks pretty solid! It's trippy, and it looks very cheesy at times, but I found it charming, in its own way. The music was surprisingly good as well! Well, sometimes.

Haha, it really is. In the first screen, you can press \"C\" to get the objective for the first level. Needless to say, the game doesn't tell you that. Regardless, if you do press it, you'll have to exit the game, as there's no way of going back. ... No clue.There are also no options what-so-ever, and the game never saves. You have to beat it in one sitting. It's very short, so I don't really mind that.No skipping, here!A big issue I've had, is that you can't skip anything. There are cutscenes, biblical text, and the game always forces it on the player... There was a point in the game where you were given a screen with a citation from the bible. The worst thing about it is that the time is predetermined. With some of the citations, it was took long, while for others it was too short, so that you couldn't even finish reading it. It's so easy to make that right... just say \"Press X to advance\" or something of the sort!From what I've seen, they really, really want you to read those passages... The game suffers as a result.The long cutscenes are also annoying, and unskippable. Even after the first playthrough, you'll have to sit through everything... Moving on...Structure & MechanicsThis game has only 4 levels, one of them being the final Boss fight. The interesting thing is that each level is basically a different genre! They don't do any of the genres well, needless to say, but it's interesting! There are some good ideas here, but they're all butchered by awful design details.I'll break this part into each level, as they're pretty short and simple to review.First LevelIn this, you have a space-ship, and 4 \"attributes\". Fuel, Ammo, Faith, and a Garden (?). The level is just a big square, with asteroids and a huge rotating creature that is invincible. Don't ask questions.Your objective is to destroy asteroids. They can drop: a bible, ammo, or an enemy -- if you destroy the enemy, you get fuel. When you destroy a big asteroid, it's broken in more, smaller asteroids, and those are the ones that drop something.Basically, you collect to bible to increase your faith. Your objective is to get your faith up to the Garden number. After you collect a bible, your faith is also increased every second, or so. You lose if you run out of fuel, or ammo.You can basically get one bible, and then just avoid things, being mostly quiet, not to waste resources.Getting hit decreases your faith (and maybe increases the Garden level, although I'm not sure).The brilliant idea to make your Faith be increased after you collect your first bible is this: Each bible gives you a citation, that appears at the bottom of the screen. Reading it, of course, is stupid. You in the middle of a video game, you can't read and shoot at the same time! So, in order for you to read it, they increase your Faith. That way, you can mostly be quiet, and able to read....Let that sink in. That makes absolutely no sense to me. I mean, it's a freaking piece of text, IN THE GAME SCREEN. Why...? N-no. Don't do that, come on. It seems completely out of context as well. Again, remember the NES \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 Bible games and you can probably understand! Oh well.Second LevelThis is more of a Gradius-like shooter, with a bit of a bullet-hell element. Your character looks like a small super-hero, with a big tin on your back. I repeat, don't ask questions.Your hit-box is really small, in the form of a red cross. However, they never explain it, and your character is huge. The enemies shoot lots of bullets, here, and you'll probably die a lot. It's just a memorization exercise. Once you know the level, you know where the enemies will spawn, and you can play accordingly. You can take 6 hits, but here's the issue: there are no invincibility frames, nor is there any feedback when you get hit. Any what-so-ever. Yep. I honestly don't understand why that it, but I also didn't take LSD before playing this.The playing field is also pretty narrow, and the edges hurt you... It's awful. There a bullethell-ish boss fight at the end, but he only has 1 phase, and it's pretty easy to beat.It sounds mostly really bad so far, right? Well, it is. But the enemies have interesting patterns! I think the level design was pretty good, honestly. Each enemy guided you in a certain way, and it felt satisfying when you beat it. But then, there are all the other issues.Third LevelThis level is just a 2D platformer. You can walk sideways, and jump. That's all. ...AH! You should never think that with this game. Actually, the level flashes with different colors, and is slowly rotating. Also, your object is to collect \"trees\" -- as in, crucified Jesuses that give you yet another biblical passage out of nowhere. Here applies the problem with the time to read it being either too short, or too long.It's easy, though.Boss Fight.I don't want to spoil this. I'm assuming you fight Satan, although I'll never know for sure. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356323651 This is another epilepsy-inducing fight, with flashing eye-bullets, and a rotating background. It's a bullet-hell, with a bit hitbox... Don't... ask.It requires attention, and I died a lot, but it's fairly short, and it didn't get too frustrating, to me.ConclusionI don't know what to feel. I mean, the game is clearly awful, despite having a few nice ideas. It's all over the place...Do NOT buy it. Seriously, it's not worth it, if you're looking for a game to play.If, however, you've gotten it for free, or you are intentionally looking for one of the weirdest and cheesiest games to play, then sure, give this one a go. It's amusing.",

        "text": "I'm sorry, I can't even bring myself to properly review this. I just can't stand playing it anymore. Confrontation is supposed to be a Tactical RPG. However, there are huge problems with both the Tactics, and the RPG. It just seems very rushed and unpolished.I'll only write about 2 general points: Story and Combat.Regarding the Story, this game seems to have a huge lore. That lore is, of course, necessary to understand what's happening. However, they decided to give you access to it through pages and pages of text in the menu... I doubt anyone will read those out of nowhere. It's clearly for the people already familiar with the universe.Besides, all the exposition is through narrated walls of texts. It's just like getting a few pages of an audiobook between each mission. It's completely separated from the game itself.Now, about the Combat. First off, it's clunky as hell. I've played a few tactical games like this before. The fact that this game is in Real-Time rather than Turn-Based only hurts it. I've played Krater, though, and however flawed, that game feels good to play. Where this fails is that it's completely unresponsive, in the literal sense of the word. You command your character to do something, and they generally just ignore it. Either that, or they take several seconds. After those seconds, someone important has already died, so tough luck.The abilities also have long cooldowns, meaning you'll only be able to use them one -- twice at most -- per encounter.The level design is also just a corridor with combat after combat. Sometimes you'll have to press levers, but that's about it.Maybe I'm not giving it a fair enough chance and it gets better later on. After 6 hours, however, it feels just like I'm starting with it, and the game has done nothing interesting... and I can withstand not interesting, as long as it still feels good to play. With the clunky mechanics at play here, though, I won't.I doubt this is very helpful, but hey, the fact that I don't have any intention of continuing with it should give you an idea.",

        "text": "Hero of the Kingdom is a hybrid between an RPG and a casual resource-management game. From the outlook, you may think it's like an old-school RTS, like I did. Reminds me of Stronghold.Once you go into it, you'll realize that it's nothing of the sort.Basically, you travel around the land, buying, gathering and selling supplies, so that you can progress, by doing quests. It's... surprisingly compelling. On paper, I'd say this game wouldn't work! After trying it, though, it managed to keep me playing to completion. There's an overarching story, but it's very clich\u00e9. It did nothing whatsoever to invest me, as there weren't any great characters or situations. It was just there.PresentationAs I said, it looks a bit old. However, I really like this graphic style. I love the way the how old RTS games looked, and this is basically an higher resolution version of that. The iconography in the game felt a bit out of place, at times, but it identifies everything well enough, so I won't complain.Other than that, the interface has a medieval feeling (especially the frames and the map) that fits the feeling of the game.The sound-effects were a bit too sparkly for me. They didn't fit the rest of the game, being more suited for a children's game, with a cartoony look. Regardless, they're otherwise functional.The music is open, I believe, but it was well chosen. There isn't much to say about it. It's pretty simple, fantasy-like background music, but it did its job of getting you into the game's atmosphere.There were a few interface issues I've had, but I've later found out that most of them could have been avoided, with a bit more explanation. Basically, everything requires 2 clicks -- always. First, you click the objective or object you want to collect, and then there's some feedback, and a box appears with a \"V\" for you to click, to continue. This last step, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary. Also, the box appears in the object's place, so you'll often have to \"backtrack\" with the mouse, if you were ready to leave the screen, or something. This is avoided by pressing SpaceBar when the box appears. That way, you can just press it and the box will go away, so it partially solves the problem -- this, however, was never hinted at, in the game.Overall, there are just lots of unnecessary clicks, in a game that's all about clicking. I believe that the visual and audio feedback was sufficient, but I may be wrong.Story and WritingAs I've mentioned, the story is completely clich\u00e9. Your farm burns, and you go on a quest to save your father and be an hero. Then, you find that there's a bigger evil on the world, and you want to eliminate it. That's about it. There's isn't any real idea to be trasmitted by it, no interesting characters, nothing whatsoever. Bottom-line: don't play it for a story.The writing also felt very amateur, in general. The game just feels like it could be written by a middle-schooler. It's not awful, but there's nothing, at any point, that will surprise you or even amuse you. The phrasing is very simple, with not character having any personality... Meh. You can easily skip it and you won't miss anything.Structure & MechanicsIt's hard to separate this from the mechanics. This game is a glorified spreadsheet, and it's almost all structure, and no mechanics.Basically, you have a character whose main attribute is stamina. You lose stamina with every meaningful action, and you'll have to sleep on a camp to recover it. There are many camps spread around the map, requiring different resources for you to use them. Some are town inns, which require money, others will simply require different types of food.Then, you'll also visit several towns that specialize in different things. There's alchemy, fishing, hunting, etc. Each requires different tools, which the townsfolk sell you. In those towns, there are also side-quests, that give you money, honor, and resources.Honor is basically used for you to unlock certain quests, that require you to be more trust-worthy.Despite the existence of several different occupations, they're all the same. Once you have a tool and skill (that you get from a quest), the maps will now have a new icon over the resource that you can gather. Then, you click it and there you go. There's no crafting per se. There are some vendors that give you a potions for herbs though, for example.Each action will require tools/resources, and stamina. Some of them also require Hunters, Repair-men, Soldiers, etc. You can buy these (as if mercenary) to help you. As you can tell, the whole game is about getting resource X and either selling or trading it for resource Y, so that you can do the next quest.Hidden-objects ComponentIn every map, there are items spread around, but that are very small and often blend with the background. These are mostly optional, but they can also be useful. These include Mushrooms, Eggs, Lost Crates, etc. These won't be unlocked from the start, you'll unlock them progressively, when following the main quest.Map The maps tells you nothing useful, but let's you fast travel to every location. So, instead of having to waste 2 minutes and 15 clicks, you'll waste 10 seconds and 2 clicks.This is fine, and I think it helps the game substancially. However, it could have been much better. Has different areas have different vendors and quests, it would have been useful to have those marked on the map. Perhaps a little quest description and the person who gave it to you, the main vendors, etc. You can very easily get lost, since you take to memorize everything. Cumbersome systemsEverytime you gather a resource, hunt, etc. you'll lose stamina, and also have a chance to break your tools. If that happens, you'll have to go buy another. Eventually, I just bought every tool twice to avoid backtracking. However, it's very cumbersome, in general. Especially with the later tasks, everything may cost up to half of your stamina. So, you'll travel, do 2 minor things, and have to go back and get more stamina. I think it's mostly unnecessary, how you constantly have to go back and forward... It never lets go of your hand -- Too LinearThe tutorial is very typical of mobile games. You have to click this very specific icon, or else you can't advance. This goes on for a while. While the game opens up a bit, it's also holding you hand. If I had focused only on the story line, it would have bored me to death, probably. It's like the game tells you its story through instructions. \"Do this. Now, do that. Good, now get that to achieve this! No, no that-- this! Here! This shiny button!\" ... It's very, very restrictive. The sidequests help a bit.Regardless, it's never an adventure of your own.Progress and AchievementsThis is the trick about this game. There's an achievement for every meaningless task. It's annoying and patronizing. However, it's one of those psychological tricks that keeps you invested. Everything feels like progress. Also, every field will disappear after being gathered \"x\" times, so there will come a point when you've literally completed the game. And I think that's the strangely compelling thing about this game!It keeps you going for far longer than I'd have guessed. The game has nothing interesting about it, but it still grabs your attention, for those 3 hours!I would not recommend this game, in most circumstances. It's very bland, and has nothing interesting about it. However, it's still compelling. Besides, it provides a good formula. If you can integrate a good story, and some mechanics into it, perhaps a great game can be made!Please, be very aware of what you're getting into. For what it is, it's good!",

        "text": "MURI is a side-scrolling action platformer, and a clear throwback to the 8-bit era! Instead of NES, though, this one tributes the DOS-side, citing  Duke Nukum as the biggest influence.While the game does very little to innovate, it's a very accessible game, especially for people unfamiliar with the difficulty of older games. If you are looking for that challenge, however, there are modes to make that happen!It's a very by the book game, in my opinion, but I think it's well done.Presentation I'm not sure if it's worth this, but the game looks like it's from the 80s, as intended! Low-res, limited color-scheme, 16fps -- it's all there! (Although there's a 32fps version, which feels much better to play)What you see in the screenshots is what you get. It seems very faithful to the era it's celebrating.It also features color-coded enemies, each color representing a difficulty-tier.Everything is well delineated, and there's never any confusion between what's an enemy, background and foreground.The sound-effects follow the same route. If you like playing your own music while playing game, those can certainly be very annoying, but you should know what you're getting into. There's one big issue, though, in the fact that there's no music! I'm not familiar with the DOS era, so I'm not sure if it was common practice for games not to have music. In NES games, though, music was one of its strong points! And it's very unfortunate that MURI does not have any. There's a very short and looping track in the menu, but on its own, it does nothing to standout.You could always listen to a podcast or something while playing it, though, without hurting the experience.StrutureThere are 4 episodes in MURI. Each episode is self-contained, and has 5 stages, one of which is a boss fight. There are no saves, as expected. However, every difficulty mode and episode is unlocked from the start. Your only worry is to play one episode at once.You can probably be done with the episodes in 20 minutes, even less if you don't bother with exploration.There are 4 (acceptable) difficulties available - Easy, Normal, Hard and MURI. I can't say for sure if the enemies actually change between these modes, but what I can say, is that they change the Health and Lives Pick-ups in the levels, depending on the chosen difficulty. Each of them has a Score Multiplier associated with it.I've played it on Normal, and then gave it a spin on MURI, just to see how it was. Normal mode should cause major problems to anyone. If you take the time to explore, you'll have more than enough lives and health pick-ups to carry you through. I didn't get any game-over in this mode. Hard will most likely be the most suitable for any more or less experienced player.MURI, on the other hand, is more of a real challenge! There are not health pick ups nor lives anywhere. You'll have 3 lives for each episode, and that's it. This was certainly not the kind of experience I was looking for when I started playing MURI, but it's good to know it's there! (I have yet to play Volgarr the Viking)Your health is restored between each stage, in all modes, which is very handy! It's also a small reward on the harder modes, to be able to take damage in moderation without it being an issue.On every stage there are tons of secrets, in the form of fake and destroyable walls, hidden platforms, etc. for you to uncover, getting score pick-ups and lives as well as ammunition for the more powerful weapons. Your score is increased by picking things up and killing enemies -- a very welcome aspect is how the game tells you when you reach 100% Score for that specific stage! I think it's very fair. It doesn't tell you too much, but you can be sure to leave the stage without leaving anything behind, if you so want.There are also hidden Cells. These will unlock the more powerful weapons for the Boss stage, but are also more challenging to get.If you lose all of your lives, you'll get a game over screen, and \"back to the menu with you\"! Again, it should not be a problem in Normal Mode, at least.Mechanics & Level DesignI've covered part of this on the previous section. No worries, there's still a bit to talk about.I've mentioned several weapons. These include your basic, infinite, slow shot. Then, there's Rapid Shot, MKV (Scatter gun), Laser gun, Explosive-shot gun, and a Crazy Barrage of Large Bouncy Shots gun. You'll be able to get ammo hidden through the stages. You always keep what you collect when you finish a stage -- except, of course, between episodes -- so exploration is highly encouraged.Your active weapon is always the most powerful one for which you have ammo. I dislike this quite a lot. I don't see a reason for not allowing the player to switch between weapons, but I couldn't find one. This leads to you wasting very valuable ammo on the weakest enemies, and then having an hard time with the tougher ones -- note that this only made a difference in MURI mode, but still.How the level-design encourages exploration First off, the game constantly teases you by showing you pick-ups inside the walls. You know you can get there; all that's left is figuring out how!The game doesn't try to hide many things. It's mostly very fair in that regard, as it gives you glimpses of possible secrets and fake walls every time.Another way that I highly respect is that they never close a door behind you -- figuratively speaking.There are no pits from which you can't get back, doors that close or anything of the sort. If you've left something behind, as long as you don't leave the stage, you can always go back to find it. This also goes hand in hand with the fact that they tell you when you reach 100% score. If they didn't tell you when you're near the exit, you've missed something -- Feel free to go back and explore some more!Enemy Variety and DifficultyThere are lots of different enemies, each with their movement pattern, health, directional shots, etc. For its low length and amount of episodes, Muri compensates with the very varied enemies and levels in general. It'll never feel repetitive during the first playthrough! And if you're actively looking for this kind of game, I'm sure you can play through it at least twice without it feeling boring at all.For each type of enemy, there are also different tiers, identified by their color. Green are the easiest, then Blue, Red and Grey, with these being the harder.The enemies are well placed, and the game is never unfair. You can always see shots coming before getting hit. Enemies outside the screen still shoot at you and take damage, so you'll have to be careful.One of the aspects characteristic of these old games is how methodical they are to play, and MURI is no different. If you rush, you'll probably get hit often, and end up losing a bunch of lives. If you play it slow, and be aware of the enemies' patterns, though, you'll be able to succeed with conviction. If you've played NES or DOS games, you'll know whether this is for you.The Boss Fights were also pretty fun, with multiple phases, as is classic. They also change depending on the difficulty you're playing on, which is always good to see!No savesI've seen some people unhappy with the lack of lives. I'd generally agree, especially in the easier difficulties, as it's very frustrating to lose a whole level of progress. However, I don't think you have anything to worry about, in this game. MURI mode is there for the more hardcore players. If you're not one of them, exploration will reward you with plenty of lives. It's old-school design, but made more accessible. I do not think it poses an issue.This one comes from Ludosity, who are yet to disappoint me. Give it a go!",

        "text": "Year Walk is a game that first came out on iOS, but it caught my attention very early on. Above all else, you have to know what you're getting into, to properly enjoy it. This is not a game, in the traditional sense, but it certainly requires player input! Even more than many games, somehow.It's a very unique experience, certainly worth trying! Plus, you might learn a bit more about swedish folklore.ContextI find it very similar to Fez, in a way. Year Walk is a riddle. Its challenges rely on concepts more than anything the game directly teaches you, but all the clues are present for you to succeed. Also, it was clearly designed for multiple playthroughs (at least 2.5 - 3), and it was brilliantly made, with that in mind.I'm a sucker for mythology and folklore in general, so I had been interested in this game for a while. If you're trying it just \"because\", you might be lost for a while, and find it frustrating.Going back to the Fez point: Fez was much harder and more cryptic, because its clues were very spread apart. There were lots of different areas, and it also relied on many skills completely unrelated to the game.Year Walk is not like that. While the game is mostly a riddle, you can get everything you need inside the game. I'd advise either taking notes, or screenshots and being very aware of your in-game surroundings, otherwise you'll probably be walking in circles.PresentationThe game is certainly fairly minimalist in its design, but I think it knew exactly what it needed to be. The visuals are digital, but made to simulate paper cut-outs, which goes hand in hand with old folklore. Its use of color is also noteworthy, and while very subtle, it very much contributes to the overall atmosphere.Interface issuesThe interface looks, perhaps, a bit too modern, but it's not too bad. The port is mostly okay, although there's a bit of disconnection to the pc, clearly. While there aren't big, intrusive buttons, they haven't really mapped any hot-keys that would have been really useful (using M for map, or E for encyclopedia, for example), and you have to click everything. Then, in a puzzle, they have you use \"u\" and \"n\"! It was the hardest puzzle for me, haha! It clearly said \"u\" and \"n\" on the screen, but it felt so out of place that it took me a while to try it. Oh well.The sound-effects are a bit space-y, which feels a bit weird, but it sort of fits. They're well done, but I would have liked something more traditional.The music, thought, is definitely one of the aspects where it shines! (Of course, this is biased.)It's mostly quiet and atmospheric, but it gives you an eerie feeling at times, through two main aspects: slight dissonance, and using what seems to be aged instruments, that don't sound quite right. These two aspects have been in my mind for a while, on how to make creepy music... So there you go. Of course, I found it great! But honestly, I think it works, and gives it a very natural feeling. Good job!There's a problem, though:No sound on the menusWhenever you open the map, or the encyclopedia, the music stops. That... is a problem, and a big one, in my opinion.In a game that relies so much on atmosphere, a continuous flow of sound is critical. If you need to open the map (which should often happen, especially during your first playthrough -- a the one that relies the most on atmosphere!), the music stops, and it completely breaks immersion. I seem to mention this in a lot of games, recently, but it's really important! Having the music cut-out when you have to do something as simple as opening a map... that's bad. Furthermore, it makes those menus seem completely out of the experience that the game was going for. I'd like to see this changed, at least in future games, but hey... it's not game-breaking, I guess.Game MechanicsTo start off, this is an adventure game. Instead of being a point n' click, however, you can walk in 2D, in several lanes set in 3D. You can go back and forth to change lane, at specific points. It can be a bit confusing, at first, but there's a map, and while your first playthrough feels a bit alien, it all makes sense after that. And it's still very compelling.Puzzles vs. RiddlesI'll make this clear right away. A puzzle, in my eyes, is based on mechanics that a game teaches you. Most games work like this.A riddle, on the other hand, relies on something beyond the game. These skills are mostly learned outside of the game, and makes what could be \"puzzles\", mostly unrelated to one another. This is why I say Year Walk is more of a riddle. There are clues inside the game, of course, but it never teaches you anything. It never starts easy and gets progressively harder. Not at all. Every riddle is like a self-contained puzzle, reliant on combining the clues, and skills you have acquired outside the game. Some of the puzzles are based on listening cues, some are based on softcryptography, etc. But I think it's balanced. I managed to go through my first playthrough without getting stuck  at any point, and without using Hints. But again, you need to be in the right mindset to enjoy it! These riddles are based on the mythological creatures you'll find in the game. You won't, of course, know what these creatures are, or why they're there. And that's normal. To complement the game, there's an Encyclopedia. This is merely a collection of texts, one about each creature or event you're playing. It's not a direct guide for the game, as it doesn't really help with the solving a puzzle, but it gives context to what you're doing! And may also give you some clues on where the solution may lie.I've found it very interesting, but it's still about reading outside the game! It's the same problem that Type:Rider had, the way it never taught you through gameplay, but through wikipedia-esque articles.Year Walk doesn't function this way! But it has some similar problems. Still, the creatures are stillin the game, but it would have felt much better to have some more integration of the Encyclopedia in the game. Maybe some more clues to the puzzles... I believe the Encyclopedia was a companion app for the iOS game, so that's it doesn't quite feel a part of the game, unfortunately.Symbolism in the gameI think this is the best part of the game, by far! Every encounter has some meaning. It will not be apparent at all, the first time. However, the game always gives you slight clues on what to do next. On your second playthrough, it's quite different. I don't want to spoil it, but it's about reading an Historian's \"diary\" while he was investigating the tradition of Year Walk. It's all reading (and there's a lot of it), and also taking notes to solve the last puzzle in the game. Again, it's completely detached from playing the game, but it's as interesting as it makes you feel like a detective!This diary tells the actual story of the, as if it happened a few centuries ago. While you're reading this, everything you encountered in the game starts making sense. This is the first part of the journal. The second is far more conspiracy-like and esoteric, but due to the very believable first part, you start questioning everything that's happened in the game, up to that point! It was one of the most compelling experiences I've recently had in a game! Every symbol is explained in the game! Not initially, but it is. And that's the way to do it! You won't leave it feeling like it was just pretentious gibberish. It's genuinely interesting, and the questions extend the game itself!Already out of words... Seriously, this is one of the most interesting experiences on Steam, and is one that's based on real folklore, which is always a plus!",

        "text": "LUFTRAUSERS is an over-the-top arcade dog-fighting game by Vlambeer. If you've played any other of their games, you know what you can expect: arcade games at their core, but with a much more modern design.Your objective is to survive as long as possible, trying to keep your combo up, and unlock plane parts by completing missions. It's you against an army, and it's pretty damn chaotic! Context I've had this game for a few months, and yet, when I first tried it, the controls didn't seem all that good, and I put it on hold... Until recently. I decided to play it for a bit more, to get used to the controls and I was very impressed! This is one of the best games of this genre I've played.It's quite similar to Super Meat Boy, in the sense that the real joy of playing it is in the subtlety of the controls. Mastering it feels very satisfying! Every ship part interacts with your overall movement, making the planes feel great to control.PresentationThe graphic style reminds my of Papers, Please!, although that may be because of the main color-scheme, as well as the soviet-esque aesthetic. It's pretty simple, but I don't really have any problems with it. Everything seems carefuly designed, especially when you take into account how few colors are used!You can always distinguish enemies and bullets clearly, with one intentional exception: clouds. Even in them, you can still see what you need, but it's... well, clouded, I guess.One really awesome addition is that you can unlock different color-schemes. Most of them aren't actually practical, giving the game a crazy psychedelic feel, but I can see some being more clear to some people. It's mostly there to keep things varied. And it's just cool to be able to change the whole look of the game for a few runs. It's something I'd like some games to have more often!The music is also pretty interesting! Everything is composed of 3 tracks: percussion, bass, and lead. Your ship also has 3 parts. You can see where this is going: The music is determined by your ship's composition! All of the tracks are in the same key and rhythm, composed so that they could be switched at will. So, every time you start a run with a different ship, the music will also be different!It's low res and old-school, but if fits the rest of the game. I really enjoyed it!StructureSo, there are 2 modes: normal, and SFMT. The latter is basically hardcore mode, and you'll often die within 5 seconds. That mode is utterly unfair, and it's there to see which players can persevere through hardship long enough to unlock the  uber plane. More on it later on.You'll start with only 1 of each part, but you'll be able to unlock up to 5 per type, by completing the missions. Each part has very different strengths and weaknesses, and will certainly change how you maneuvre your ship.There is only one missions per part, in SFMT, but they're far harder than their normal counterparts (well, mostly one, but still...). There are also missions for the Random part. As the name indicates, a part of the type is chosen when you launch. There's only one \"map\", if you will. There's water at the bottom, and dangerous clouds on the top, but of which will hurt you. Enemies spawn in waves, of several types. More and bigger enemies will spawn depending on the enemies you've previously kill, making the progression very dynamic. While there's still a great deal of randomness, you can kill the enemies most convenient for your objective (spawning a special enemy, getting higher score, surviving longer, etc.)Some of the missions are based on spawning a Blimp, or an Unclassified ship. Part of the fun is in figuring out when these spawn and out to do it more or less consistently. The forums are also fairly active, with people figuring it out in a group, instead of just checking a guide.You can play the game for the highscores (with leaderboards!) or to complete every mission. The missions are very nice to make you learn the game! First off, you'll have to use different combinations! And second, the missions are also more of less designed for the part's strengths and weaknesses. They're there to help you realize how to play them in a certain way, taking full advantage of it.The game is also hard as nails, so you'll keep going back to it to reach higher and higher, so you might as well try everything!Control and MechanicsThis is undoubtedly, the most important part of LUFTRAUSERS, how the ship controls.Basically, you use Left/Right to rotate, and then the Boost to propel yourself in the given direction. I'm sure there's a significant number of games that use this scheme, but I was used to traditional twin-stick shooters, so it definitely felt weird, at first. Once you get the hang of it, though, it's amazing!This is not all, though. Every weapon also has a recoil associated with it, so you'll also be sent back, by some weapons. The propellers are stronger than weapons, of course, but it's the interaction between the two that's so satisfying.Also from that, each part is really different from one another. For example, there's one that gives you a very strong boost, but your turning speed while boosting is very low; One makes you immune to water, but clouds hurt you more; One shoots bullets to propel you, but is weaker than most, while damaging enemies behind you... I won't spoil more of these.The weapons range from a laser, to a spread gun, to a cannon with a very slow recharge... etc.The body mostly controls your HP, and resilience to damage. There are a few differences, though. For example, one drops periodical bombs, while another has a nuke on death. There's one that makes you immune to collision against other planes, but has much less HP. etc.One important aspect! Your ships regenerates health. However, that only happens while you can shoot, but are not! This means, if your weapon is reloading, you will not heal. If it's ready, though, and you're not shooting, you'll heal. Bullets are very damaging, so you have to very carefuly balance when you're shooting, and when you're not.BottomlineEven the description of the game is taking too many words...! The point is: the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. Everything seems to be part of a major clockwork design. Everything works together beautifuly and is really a blast to play!If you like score-attack games, and are willing to stick with the controls for the initial habituation, I'm sure you'll not be disappointed!Now, onto the interesting aspects at play.The game encourages you to try different combinations and learn how to master itAs I've mentioned, the missions are a major focus on this game, with the intent of teaching you. It's a commonly used tactic, nowadays, but it works, here! It's a great way of keeping things varied, never feeling stale. Besides, it keeps you engaged.Missions pull you inIn a sense, it keeps you always expecting something else. Many times I find myself stopping to play a game, because I'm not sure it still has something to show me. In here, you're always teased with these missions, and even the achievement. There's something big to look forward to, and it keeps you coming back! One more try!Yep, it's that kind of game! As soon as you die, you'll want to jump right back it! Each run shouldn't take you much longer than 5 minutes, if you're lucky. It's hectic and stressful, but in the best of ways. It's challenging and, at times, almost frustrating, but you know that it's always your fault when you die (not on SFMT, that's a freaking nightmare, it's unbalanced, but there's a purpose to it...).I would be repeating myself, at this point. Definitely give it a go, it's f'n awesome!",

        "text": "First I thought this was an RPG Maker game. It's nothing of the sort, so don't be mistaken due to the artstyle.Owl Cave, the developing team, is clearly fond of old-school point n' click games, and this is exactly that! Honestly, there isn't much to it, as a game, to make it stand out. It doesn't have any interesting mechanic, or anything of the sort. It's visual and audio design is also very minimal.Where it shines, however, is in its story! I've taken a few points to write about, but it's mostly about how they could have made it more of a game, and also overcome the downsides of old point n' clicks, with their very sluggish movement, and some frustrating puzzle design. This game avoids most of that, though, using the puzzles merely to get you more into the story. I will not, of course, review the story, and I'll avoid spoilers, but I'm very positive on it, overall.PresentationThis is, by far, the weakest aspect of the game!I've seen some people disappointed, claiming it's \"MSPaint Graphics\". It's not that bad, for sure. But you can definitely understand that reaction. It has a very low resolution, and also simple and outdated tile sets. The structures' perspective is also a bit off... All in all, this is not something you'll play for sight-seeing in the least. However, it has just enough to carry the story, and giving each scene the right atmosphere, in this barren and anarchic world.Unfortunately, it's very static, which is okay, but I would have liked it not to have been in one particular aspect: the character portraits. They're always the same! I realize that it was perhaps more work than it warranted, but it was a chance to add a lot of personality into the game, as I see it. Just having the portraits be in sync with their tone. Heh, it's not very important, but could have been better.The music seems to be equally as low-fi, strangely enough. It's not 8 or 16 bit or anything like that, but it somehow feels... old? It's strange to describe it. But it's mostly ambience music and sound effects, complementing the visuals to set the stage for the dialog. I found it surprisingly fitting in the game.Everything loops well and nothing felt out of place.There is no voice-acting.I appreciated the writting quite a lot! You can understand the tone in each character's line, and the dialogue options that they give you are always legitimate. I'll talk about this further ahead, but there are a few choices that will affect the endings, although you may not initially realize it. General StructureThere are 2 main characters in Richard & Alice, unsurprisingly. You're both in a prison, and all you can do is talk to each other, in separated cells. Mostly,it's about you, Richard, listening to Alice's story, about how she got there.The game alternates between the characters. The smallest chunk of the game is in the cells, where you play as Richard, speak to Alice, and solve some very minor puzzles. It also helps you understand the world around you a bit more.The biggest chunk, is where you play as Alice and her son, Barney, following how she was \"arrested\".The prison sections are mostly there to break up the pacing, which is surprisingly good! The game never felt tiresome or to drag on as a result.Puzzles and GameplayThe first thing you'll notice, is how sluggish the movement is. You shouldn't be unfamiliar with it, if you're used to point n' click games... it's always their sore spot! This game is just the same. It's a bit awkward to move, and even to pick things up. You left click to use and right click to inspect. And that's basically all you need to know.You can also advanced dialogue by clicking, skipping to the next line. There's a way to skip a scene entirely (scenes which you do not control) by holding SpaceBar -- This is never explained in the game...You can always Save/Load at any time, which is great! There are a couple of bugs, sometimes, which can easily be fixed by simply reloading, without losing any progress.There isn't much to the puzzles, honestly. It's mostly about exploring the scenes, collecting items, and then using them in the right place, or combining them. It's very standard in the genre. There isn't any pixel-hunting, and you'll generally be able to solve them rather quickly. During most of the game, the areas are also fairly small, so every solution to a give puzzle is nearby, avoiding the slow walking that usually comes with these puzzles. Unfortunately, there are 2 (maybe) scenes that have 3 areas you can visit and in those, you'll have to walk back and forth, very slowly, until you find the right items. That was a bit frustrating to me, as are most of point n' click games, but it was nothing unbearable. Honestly, they've avoided most of it, so that's good! It will not get in the way of the story.Well... I think that covers it. As I can't review the story, it's hard to tell you what this game does right. The game itself is serviceable, but the way it paces the story, and gives you some freedom within it is where it shines. This is definitely not something you'll play for the puzzles or mechanics. If you enjoyed To the Moon, Primordia, Home, etc. I think you'll definitely appreciate this.The story is quite mature, and the world has gone to hell, but the story it tells is credible, and there are certainly many aspects with which the player can identify with. Some people found it depressing, which is understandable, so know what you're getting into. I don't think it's anything shocking, but it's definitely not a light-hearted and happy story. It's a lot about what people would do if faced with risk of survival. It's not about zombies, or nuclear war. In fact, the setting is never explained, as it's there as a mere symbol/concept. And that's all I'll say about it. The issue I've had with the puzzles was simply the fact that you can easily miss a very specific item, for an ambiguous purpose. What I mean by that is that several other items in your inventory could provide you with the exact same utility \u2013 but of course, the game doesn't aknowledge that, and will leave you walking in circles, re-inspecting everything. That's not something I like, of course, but changing that would probably require a whole re-design of how puzzles are done in the genre, which is far outside the scope of the review. One last thing.How choice is handled in the different endingsFrom what I understand, the most important choices, are the ones you make when talking to Barney. These are usually question about the state of the world that you, as a player, may not know about. It's interesting, really. It's an uninformed decision, yet, it's a valid one, since you're basically telling your son how the world is, and sometimes how people interact. And how you choose to show him, is how the ending will be presented, in a way. The ending is based both on deduction done with the clues you've found (depending on the notes you find, your actions in the end may change, thus changing the ending), and also based on how you chose to see the world.All in all, it will be very fitting to you, personally, and how you've played the game, it's very good!The downside to it, is that getting several endings may be a bit laborious (since you'll have to replay big portions of the game that doesn't change much, expect for the ending), and also that the forum discussion will not be as interesting. Take Home, for instance. That game's discussion were based on what actually happened in the game, not just the ending. And it was great! Since in this game they're mostly about its conclusion, discussion will not be as nice. To be honest, I think it's good news, if such an issue is what I throw at your game, haha! I enjoyed it a whole lot!",

        "text": "Mind: Path to Thalamus is another entry into the narrative focused art games. This one struck me as having been highly influenced by Dear Esther (especially in the tone and pace of the narration, as well as some of the areas), coupled with a more puzzle-driven experience, not unlike Portal (its intent being completely different, though).Unfortunately, the writing was weak, in my opinion, and the game seems very incoherent in its quality. Some parts of the game were truly good, blending its audio-visual design very nicely with the puzzles, while others just fell flat on their face, with far more generic looks, and puzzles whose pieces were simply hidden, leading to a frustrating experience.PresentationThe first thing that strikes you in M:PtT is its visual fidelity. It has high quality textures and shaders that are very well used, especially at the start of the game. The skyboxes are  majestic -- that's the best way to describe it, very detailed and often chaotic, in a good way  -- paired well with the lighting effects. It's just an awesome looking game, if you like wandering around and sightseeing. Doesn't quite hold itself the whole way throughThe only complaint I have with it is that, while the beach areas seem are brilliant, with a bit of classic architecture and nicely reflecting sand, some of the other areas are far blander. There was a cave almost identical to the one in Dear Esther (which is unfortunate, because it's certainly beautiful, despite losing the unique factor), and there are some cannyon-esque areas that are not that awe inducing.The plain areas are also very well done with their use of color and foliage, very cool! There are also some more other-wordly realms that look pretty good.The only technical problem with it was the popping that happened due to the low draw-distance with some objects, even with everything maxed.The sound design was also very much alike Dear Esther. It's mostly very quiet and relaxing, with the occasional piano piece, and calm narration. It's certainly very atmospheric, and while not particularly memorable, I think it helps  carrying the experience!I have a few problems with the writing. Presumably, it was too esoteric and pretentious when the game launched, so they've rewritten the script, making the story more clear. Unfortunately, they've completely removed the old script, as it seems. I wanted to try it out for myself, but I don't think that's possible. What's left, is a perhaps too direct and concrete script about the story of the game. So concrete that it lacks identification with the player, unless you were in a similar situation... Which deals with running from a tornado. Not something many people have ever been involved with, I'd say!This is perhaps not 100% fair, as there are aspects with which one could identify himself, but they're also so prevalent nowadays that it's a bit tiresome (related to guilt and family issues).This story is given between the puzzles, during otherwise dead time. Since two of the characters share the same name (for story reasons) it can be a bit confusing at times to know who exactly the game's talking about, due to the fragmented exposition.Regardless, I don't think it's bad, just felt a bit underwhelming, taken the rest of the presentation. I think I would have liked to at least play through the original script.General MechanicsThe game's puzzles revolve around \"manipulating weather\". However, it's not as cool as it sounds, and it's only so metaphorically speaking. The main characters (from what I understood, a family tradition of sorts) studies weather phenomena. There's the connection.However, how the weather changes affect the game's mechanics is completely untied to actual weather, working just as a mechanic. With which there's nothing wrong, but it feels like the developer tried a bit too hard and in the end dropped the ball, for the most part.The puzzles are a mixture of conception and execution, the latter relying on the physics system, which is not very well explained at all.You have a neuro-something sphere, that you place in an element circle, to activate it. You can also stand on those circles yourself to activate said weather mechanic. You can control Fog, Day and Night, Rain, and Time. Night opens up portals, and something gives you a ball that only appears during the night, Rain rises platforms, Fog gives you access to small area (and propulsion -- where the physics come in), and Time reconstructs some buildings. -- Looking back at it, there's connection between the mechanics and the actual story, though very subtle.Generally, you wander around the levels, find the pieces, and then place the sphere and yourself sequentially, following a very linear path to the end of the level.It certainly sounds good in concept! And sometimes, they were nicely designed, on other times, not really. I'll now discuss the particular points that made this game frustrating, to me.1.Invisible and/or Artificial WallsThis is a big sore spot, to me. The game features these very fast, ever expanding areas that look absolutely amazing. There's also an almost perfect ballance between empty space and \"landmarks\" in some levels. However, once you try to go off the path, the game blocks you path with an invisible walls. On the first levels, this wasn't really an issue, as it seemed to give you quite a lot of freedom. later on, though, it revealed itself as something different.For such an atmospheric experience, letting the player wonder would be far for enjoyable -- perhaps having an improved Dear Esther influence, maybe even giving some of the more esoteric script passages to the player during those moments. The biggest issue with this, though, is how they place a single pillar or tree off in the distance, isolated from everything else. In any other game, this would be like a beacon, something for the player to investigate! Of course, once you walk 5 steps, you'll encounter an invisible wall. It feels so counter-intuitive... If there's to be a wall there, don't place those beacons. I mean, since so obvious that I'm not sure I'm missing some deep metaphor, here... Oh well. It could be much more by changing this simple aspect.2.Puzzles are most about finding the pieces than putting them togetherSounds cute, but what exactly do I mean. Aside from being very limiting, exploration-wise, the levels can be quite large -- which may sound contradictory, but stick with it.While somewhat large, they're very linear in where you can go. However, since the various pieces are so spread, every solution you might think of, will often take more time than it needed. Moreover, if it fails, you'll have to wander around for some more time, because it's not very clear, most of the time.For example, one puzzle was literally about taking the sphere and walking in a very defined path in front of you. You would finish the level in 10 seconds. However, that was only due to its initial conditions. If you took the sphere and went somewhere else, you would break those conditions. I felt rather lost, to be honest. The problem with that level was that you could not see the consequences of your actions. This happens more than once.This is very frustrating. You could solve the puzzles by pure luck quickly -- otherwise, you'd have to rely on guesswork and trial and error.ConclusionEnough rambling. I think I've written about my biggest problems with Mind: Path to Thalamus.It's a very beautiful game, and the first level really impressed me, even from a puzzle standpoint. Unfortunately, the rest of the game doesn't seem to have as much work and polish put into it, and ends up having some very frustrating puzzles, hurting the rest of the experience a lot.",

        "text": "Memories of a Vagabond is a small RPGMaker game. That's about it. Aside from 2 or 3 aspects that I may like the game for, this seems to be 90% filler content. It's a functional RPG without a heart of its own. There isn't really an idea or a purpose for the story, and neither is there an interesting combat system.It's unfortunate for me to start the review like this, but this is what I've felt during the whole experience.ContextFirst off, I got this game for free. I've seen it around in bundles and/or giveaways a few times, and decided to give it a go. I didn't go in with any expectations, but unfortunately, the game did nothing to win me over. It didn't do anything too wrong either! It's just not interesting at all.I beat it on Hard Mode in 5 hours.As with every other RPG Maker game, the engine doesn't allow for resolution options, only Fullscreen on/off; when I go fullscreen, it screws the aspect ratio up, so I can either play with the screen displaced and low resolution, or in a tiny window.Aside from that, I haven't had any technical issues. I've read quite a few reviews on steam, and they're mostly positive, which I don't understand. I mean, JRPGs aren't all that common on PC, but Memories of a Vagabond does absolutely nothing to stand out or be a memorable experience...However, I do respect the developer for supporting this game nicely. From what I've seen, he's been solving problems posted in the Community Hub, and is also launching a patch tomorrow. Anyway, here's the review.PresentationThe visuals here are mostly standard. A few of the objects are pretty nicely designed, but there isn't much to say.The combat effects look pretty smooth, which I appreciate, but it's nothing mind-blowing. The combat backgrounds have a different style, being seemingly hand-drawn (well, digitally, but you get the idea). They're fairly simple, but it gives the game a bit more personality.There were also some graffities spread around. These were completely out of place, in this fantasy setting. I'm not sure if they're an inside reference or what, but it seems completely random to have these.The music, as noted by other reviewers, is certainly the game's highlight. And I didn't even consider it that good, for the most part. It's fitting with the locations, but it's mostly orchestrated, which I don't think fits very well with these low-res games. But again, it's good, especially the one from the last Boss. That was certainly a well chosen song!The sound-effects and menus were, once again, standard. I've had a few interface issues, though. Those problems were caused mainly by some of the mechanics, so I'll right about it when I get there (1).The writing and story has probably been my least favorite aspect of this game. It just seems very amateur, the characters have nothing interesting about them (on the contrary, many of them seem very childish), and the story is also a very bland damsel in distress scenario.The game's tries to keep a more or less serious tone (no too serious, but serious), but then throws in some really out of place jokes.. I don't understand what it was trying to do, to be honest. There was a funny area near the last area, but again, it just came out of nowhere.Game's StructureIn here, you go through Dungeon-ish areas, and also have an Overworld, to travel between them. The areas are pretty small (including the overworld).There are no random encounters! You can always see the enemies walking around, so you can approach them at will, and when you're ready. I think that's good. Also, once you kill the enemies in the dungeons, they're dead and do not respawn. If you're having difficulty issues, you can grind a bit in the Overworld (a couple of levels make all the difference, and are quick to get).Other than that, there are a few sidequests, with very minor rewards (both in terms of equipment and interesting events, they're completely filler).There is also an Arena of sorts, where you battle increasingly difficult groups of enemies. I always like this idea in RPGs. However, the game doesn't take advantage of it at all. There's no adrenaline-pumping ambience to it or anything. You go in, fight, and get back out. At the end of each fight you'll get a pretty decent reward (in gold, items and equipment).There's one fatal flaw with this, though. The arena's difficulty is not scaled with the main game at all.I've only managed to finish 3 fights before the enemies got too strong for the point in the game. I could have endured it, maybe grinded a bit, and tried to keep going, but there was not point! After the third fight, I went and beat the final boss without any problem at all. I had the best equipment available (by simply buying it from shops) and yet, the arena's difficulty was already too high. Yet another elements that feels pointless and misused.I suppose it was intended as an end-game thing, perhaps. Without an interesting combat system, however, I have no desire of trying it out.Combat SystemAs is to be expected, you can use a Basic Attack, Skill, or Item. Skills require mana to use, and can be normal attacks with an added bonus, or status ailments. The status ailments, however, are completely useless against basic enemies, and cannot be used against Bosses (or at least their hitting rate is reeeeally low), so there's a big portion of the combat rendered useless. Most of the time, you'll be going between strong attacks, AOE, and healing. There isn't any deep strategy to the combat. Battles usually take no more than 3 turns, with Bosses being the exception, just because of their amount of HP.There are no phases, interesting skills, or anything of the sort. Everything is just as you've seen in every other JRPG. It does, once again, nothing to stand out.Not replenishing your pools after each fight -- relation with Random Encounters and DifficultyThere's one huge problem I have with it, though, that modern RPGs seem to have eliminated. That is how you have to manually heal and restore your HP after a fight. Most of recent RPGs take the route of each battle being self-contained. This way, you don't need to worry about the time between battles, and just wasting time buying and managing potions. There's another design route that comes with this, and that's taking the random encounters out. With random encounters, it makes sense for you to be \"permanently\" damage, making the dungeons tense. With a limited number of enemies, however, that stops working in the game's favor. Another possibility is making each battle almost like a puzzle. Each battle can be harder, but also far more interesting. Without the nuisance of having to buy and manage potions, you can have more difficult fights that bring you to the limit, without it being a problem. As it stands, it just ends up being a couple of conflicting design decisions that make the combat much worse.There's also an element to the attack types (with Fire, Wind, Earth, Ice, etc. having weaknesses and strengths) but with the fights in the game, they're useless. The enemies don't really have an apparent type so that you can play with that in mind. It's mostly guess-work. But in the couple of hours of this game, there's no chance to use that strategically.ConclusionI'm sorry for being this harsh on a small game like this, especially when the developer cares for the game. If this was a first game, more like an experiement, then that's fine. It's functional, despite the many flaws, and everyone learns from mistakes.Still, I can't recommend this, when there are so much better games out there. I didn't enjoy it at all, due to it lacking personality. There's nothing that the game's trying tell or do, unfortunately.",

You'll solve puzzles by reading people's minds, and manipulating them into thinking about a certain item that you can use somewhere else on the chapter. It's certainly not a hard game, with it nicely structured levels, always subtly guiding your way, never proving frustrating.It's been said to be \"Psychonauts\" spiritual successor. While I have not played Psychonauts, I've played other Double Fine games, and the influence is clear! While the game mechanics don't seem to take the spotlight, they're very well conceived, and fit very well with the game's theme and aesthetics. It was one of the more enjoyable games I've recently played!PresentationThis is probably the highlight in this game. Everything from the visuals, to the music and the voice acting is awesome!It's a very colorful game, done in 2.5D. This is achieved by making every sprite like a cardboard cutout. The levels are then set in layers. While the game is mostly 2D, you can sometimes walk back and forth, discovering some charming details that would otherwise be blurred.The character design is also great. While everyone looks silly, their designs clearly shows their personality, coupled with the problems you'll solve and the voice acting... It's good.The music is mostly jazz (it reminded me of the bebop soundtrack in Grim Fandango, maybe a bit silly at times) with a bit of sci-fi synth thrown in, at times. I really liked it, and it's certainly something that not only fit the game, but it's also something I'll listen to after I'm finished with the it! (You can get it here: http://stickittotheman.bandcamp.com/releases with a PayWhatYouWant model)The sound-effects Also fit well with the cartoony style. Never felt out of place, so that's good.The voice-acting was also great! Reinforcing the characters and the overall feel of the game, and was mostly well done! There were a few characters that felt a bit inconsistent, but nothing too major. Also, you can rewind and fastforward their speech, making the voices even sillier, with a higher tone, if you're in a hurry. It's these details that make this game so enjoyable, honestly!The game's writing is great as well! It's not anything deep, as you can imagine (although it does hint at some major issues, in a very lighthearted way), but it's certainly funny, if you're into this kind of humor.General StructureThe game's divided by chapters, each with its theme, set of characters and puzzles. You can always go back to previous chapters through the menu, so you don't need to worry about missing an objective and being blocked from going back. This is something I very much appreciate! I hate being blocked for apparently no reason. Most of the chapters also have some achievements. Most of them are just a guide to silly characters that were more well hidden. It's a good use of them, to be honest! There are a couple of them that were more skill-based, if you're into that. But the Stick it to the Man! is a very laid-back game, and it never really tests your skills or patience.Each level has lots of checkpoints, and you'll never lose any progress. The worst that can happen is you being sent a few meters back, but you never lose items or conversations.Each level is about 20-40 minutes long. It felt just the right length for me. I played each chapter in one sitting, sometimes 2, and it never felt too short or to drag on. Also, since the levels can be fairly long, walking back would be a pain. As such, they've implemented a sort of fast travel system. Once you reach a certain point, a pipe open up, and you can go back instantly (and go forward once again).It's a very comfortable game to play, as weird as it sounds. It's never frustrating, you're unlikely to walk around back and forth pointlessly, it's not punishing... just a nice, funny experience, overall.MechanicsBasically, you're hit on the head, and an alien just happens to casually get into your brain. When that happens, a giant floppy pink hand grows out of your head, which only you can see. Nah, of course you're not crazy! It's alieeeens. Anyway. This giant hand gives you the ability of reading people's minds, and materialize their thoughts. As freeing as it sounds, it's a very \"linear\" game. They'll only think of things you need, of course.When you encounter a character, you'll learn about their problems, and then have to find the solution, somewhere. The game's is very similar to a point n' click. However, while the solution aren't too obvious, at first (since they're very non-sensical -- in a good way!), you can easily find everything by walking around and getting more items. If you have more than one, you'll store them, and can switch between them with the mouse-wheel.If you stay put, your character will also say something about the item, leading you in a general direction. There are also very subtle environmental hints, so I doubt you'll get stuck.So yeah. You'll walk around the level, speaking to the characters and reading their thoughts, often leading to some very peculiar situations, as you solve their problem in funny ways.Again, it's not a game you'd play for the mechanics, but they're still very well put together! They fit with the theme, and even amplify it, never proving a nuisance, unlike other games in a similar style. It's very well designed!It's pretty hard for me to get more to talk about. The game is very good, but it doesn't seem to do anything that jumps out at you. Everything just seems to fit together brilliantly, to me.For an adventure game, the 2D platforming certainly helped, against the traditional Point n' Click styleUsually, games like this opt for the point n' click genre, rather than 2D platforming. As a result, their movement system is also very clunky and slow, going around the screens, taking seconds of waiting at a time. Stick it to the Man! avoids that entirely, by giving you total control at all times!It makes the game incredibly better, in my eyes. It's not that I have anything against Pn'C games, but I usually find myself frustrated when I have to walk back and forth very slowly, simply to try a random combination of items.This game, however, makes movement faster, and every scene seems to have some little detail that makes the walking around even more enjoyable.Lack of punishmentThere are games that benefit from being punishing and challenging. This is not one of them, and the developers recognized it very well. It's not that there isn't any challenge. There certainly is (mostly by being chased around the guards -- which people didn't enjoy very much!), but even if you \"fail\", you don't lose progress, and the more challenging sections are short, just keeping things varied. The puzzles keep moving you forwardLast point I want to make. You rarely have to backtrack to solve a puzzle, at least to the point of annoyance. You'll usually gather items as you go, and use them either very near the place, or further ahead. On the times you do have to go back, the solution are clear, and there's usually an easy game to get back. Again, the point of the game is to present you with a silly story and character interactions, and it does that very well!ConclusionI don't have anything else to say, honestly. I really, really enjoyed the whole way through. It's on the short side, but it's certainly worth it. If you like Double Fine's games (the Stacking and Grim Fandango particularly coming to mind -- And Psychonauts for most people), give this one a go! I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Even if you don't... if the description sounds appealing, I still recommend it. It's just a very good game!",

        "text": "Ittle Dew is a little game that stands somewhere between Zelda and Sokoban, with a very humorous tone, and featuring friendly game design, with aspects that can be appreciated by pretty much everyone.From casual playthroughs, so rock-hard puzzles and 15 minutes speedruns... it's got it all! It's weird, but it's very nice to see how almost every aspect of this game seems to just fit it and provide a great experience, despite its apparent simplicity!PresentationUndoubtedly, one of its strongest aspects, especially at first. The cartoon-y artstyle is very well done, with a pleasant color scheme, very clean, with added lighting effects modernising its look, somewhat. The highlight here for me, though, is the character design. Everyone looks unique, is a clumsy and silly way, and with their own backstory to support them. It's pretty good! Another detail I liked is how every line moves slightly, making everything seem more alive.The music and sound-effects didn't standout out too much for me, but fit nicely with the rest of the presentation, and it wasn't bad by any means! Just didn't seem to carry the experience, for me.I also found the writting to be funny at times, and it just gave the game a very light-hearted and self-aware tone the whole way through. Ranging from the dialogues with your health-potion drunk companion, to the enemies' entrances and the mocking signposts spread around, everything had something to make fun of.How's the game structured?Very much like a Zelda game, actually. You have an island to explore, and go through several dungeons to beat it. There is also some exploration done outside the main and tutorial dungeons.Near the beginning of the game, you'll find a shop. The shopkeeper tells you he can give you a raft to escape the island, if you get him the artifact in the castle. And off you go. He also has 3 items to sell. You'll find the gold for it in the castle. The game's puzzles revolve around these 3 items: you'll have to combine their abilities in very varied ways to solve the puzzles.The castle has many shortcuts, that you can take by solving much harder puzzles. If you're stuck, you may as well try another way, or go buy another item. There are many different ways of making progress, too!The castle puzzles are pretty straighforward, though, so anyone can safely play it without fearing getting frustrated.Outside the castle, though, there are other smaller dungeon, with harder puzzles. These usually contain Cards with the game's characters. These are merely collectibles, but they're pretty charming too. The puzzles there can also hint at some mechanics you may have not learned throw the tutorial puzzles. As a segue, when you have enough gold, you can take one of several portals spread around the castle to fast travel. When you buy an item, you'll be catapulted into another part of the island. These are the tutorial areas. Your items are all stored near the shop, and you'll have to beat the dungeon only with your newfound item. With this, you'll learn how the item works well enough, and do that through play! I think it's a nice way of doing it.These dungeons also contain several paths and shortcuts. One important thing is that you'll never be able to leave the cave while missing important items. When you leave the dungeon, it will be sealed, but you can rest assured that you haven't missed anything important. This is also told to you after your first dungeon, in a sign post. The placing of that was very elegant: since there are multiple paths, it's very likely that you'll miss part of the map, and become worried after leaving the dungeon. Right when you're worrying about it, the signpost clarifies it for you.There are many places like this in the game, making tutorialisation nicely paced. Information is often delivered at the right moment!I think that about covers it.General MechanicsThis game has both combat and puzzles, although the focus is mainly on the puzzles. There are also some Boss Fights, most of which are more puzzle-driven than combat, although both blend rather nicely, items being multi-purposed.The combat is very straightforward. Your basic attack attacks the tile in front of you. There are also projectiles attacks. There are several different enemies, some that attack only in front of them, some have projectiles, etc. Different enemies require different approaches. Also, they'll respawn each time you enter the room, but it's never a problem as they're easy to avoid. Some puzzles also reset, but only when the initial conditions are necessary for you to solve another puzzle in the room (or perhaps to use a shortcut).The only problem I've had with the combat, is how the movement is a bit floaty, and there's a lack of knock-back with some enemies. The enemies often drop hearts to replenish your health, and the game is overall not punishing in the least, so it's not too big of an issue. Lack of PunishmentThat's mostly a good thing, but it sometimes holds the player's hand too much. For example, Boss fights have 3-5 phases, and there's usually a checkpoint between each. I've found that mostly unnecessary, taking the little challenge that they provided. I think boss fights should still be a threat!On the other hand, each time you die, you'll simply reset the room, but never lose progress, or collectibles at all. That's a very welcome thing! It's always annoying to do 4-5 rooms again when you die, or lose progress over a simple miss-step.The puzzles are basically Sokoban, with a few twists. You have 3 items: a Flaming Sword, a Freezing Wand, and a Teleporting Wand.The sword can set bombs on fire, to explode after a few seconds. The Freezing Wand can freeze enemies and blocks (making them very slippery when you push them, and also breakable), and can also freeze a wall, making it reflective.The Teleporting Wand can create a Green block anywhere. If you hit bombs or enemies with the projectile, they'll teleport over to that block. This is basically all you need to know.You combine these techniques with some more subtle quirks to the tiles and timing, and you can be faced with some evil difficult puzzles.Difficulty.Ittle Dew sets its casual from its hardcore puzzlesUsually, to beat the game, you have some fairly easy puzzles. To collect the cards, it's a different matter (although mostly doable). There's a final dungeon with 12 puzzles however, that is really hard! At least for someone inexperienced in Sokoban. I often had to peek into a walkthrough, and was constantly surprised with a new way of combining my items.Precision and Perfection rather than simply solving a puzzleThe problem is that some of these puzzles required extremely precise timing, with the game's controls don't provide very well, in my opinion. Also, these puzzles constantly made you restart at every wrong move. A time rewinding mechanic would be welcome, even if just on this cave. I had to restart these puzzles many times, making it a bit too frustrating. It wasn't just a puzzle to solve, it was something that heavily relied on execution, which I'm not a fan of.Then again, these were completely optional! And the game warned you that they were hard. If you complete it, you'll get some more cards, and also Development info, which is very cool!H.Mention: The castle can be solved with ANY combination of 2 items. I'm very impressed with this! The castle is so nicely designed that you can beat it with any combination of the two items, and the game aknowledges that with achievements. Also for cards, speed, etc.There are many ways of playing Ittle Dew, which is why I think it's a neatly designed game. Many ways that tie together brilliantly!Full Recommendation. Also, check Card City Nights!",

        "text": "Blue Flamingo is a game that came out of nowhere, from Might & Delight. Previous efforts being PiD and Shelter, this one yet is another addition to the unique looking games that they usually produce!Unfortunately, this one is by far the weakest, in terms of mechanics. It's far too limited in what it does, and tries to counter that fact by the old philosophy of \"make it hard to make up for content\". If you're very much into climbing leaderboards, this might be for you. Otherwise, unless you want to give it a go for the visuals alone, I'd say look elsewhere.Also, it's NOT a bullet-hell. It's a more traditional shoot 'em up, without the level design. You have a big hitbox, and enemies don't shoot bullets in intricate patterns.ContextFor those not aware, Blue Famingo's models, particle and soundeffects were all handmade, even the levels! (Of which there are only 2, and understandably so)As an art project, it's amazing. The game ended up looking really good, but there are few technical issues that I'm inclined to believe that were due to making the game \"by hand\".Nonetheless, you can probably find the photos of the development (they were free on the Humble Bundle, when this game was featured) and it's certainly interesting to see. They also have a few videos on their youtube channel.This is clearly a passion project. Their intentions were probably to make something different and unique, although they've given little thought to the game itself, as it seems. I wanted to recommend it, but that's only possible with very big restrictions.PresentationThe screenshots don't make this game justice. Everything looks really good, from the models, to the lighting and the particle effects made with firecrackers... It looks really, really good! Unfortunately, while pretty to look at, it creates some important issues when it comes to making a shoot 'em up.The music and sound effects were equally good, unsurprisingly. Retro Family are the ones behind this game's music once again, with a jazz-y lounge music approach. There are only two songs, but they didn't seem to get repetitive (although I didn't spend that long with the game). The sound effects also complement the visuals very well.Everything feels very mechanic, in a good way! It also feels almost like a realistic shmup, weirdly enough. The sound effects seem similar to the WW2 cannons, giving your plane a nice punch.I'd advise turning them down a bit, as they overpower the music too much. Fortunately, there are separate sliders!So, what are the issues with the visuals?1.FramerateFor one, the 2 levels were filmed. They built the level, and they've then filmed it, from bottom to top. I'm not sure if this was a problem with the camera they've used, but the game is locked at 100 fps. This is not a smooth framerate at all! Either 60 or 120 would be great, but 100 just feels weird, clearly a problem in a shmup.2.Lighting and ExplosionsAlso, the explosions from the destroyed ships seem to make the game stutter. The effects from these explosions, while pretty, have a tendency to obsfuscate the screen, hiding enemy bullets. The same issue happens when your bullet hits an enemy's bullet. Yours explode in smoke, while theirs keep going, now hidden.Another related problem, is that the enemies have a very similar color scheme to the background. At night, the enemies feature a small presence light, but are otherwise easily blended with the playing field. Again, it looks good, and gives it a very realistic (like) feel, but encumbers gameplay.I think this covers the issues I had with its presentation. Again, it's one of the prettiest games I can recall. But it's certainly flawed.Game's StructureThere are only two levels in this game (visually), and the field is the same. One, is during the day. The other, during the night, with all the colorful lights that come with it.It's an endless score attack game, so it simply alternates between them.Levels have a fixed length (since the real field was only so long). You start in the hangar, with a few seconds of preparations, and then the level starts, with enemies coming. When you reach the sea, the level is ending, and there will be a \"target\" round for you to simply gain $$.At the end of each level, you'll have 3 options: keep all of your money (with a 10% increase by the next level), spend it to upgrade your weapon, and spend it to buy another bomb.There's no way of repairing your ship, which makes the games very short, for people who are not into these kinds of games.That's basically it. Weapon upgrades simply increase your rate of fire, and by very small increments too.General MechanicsIn Blue Flamingo, you just move and shoot, with the optional use of a bomb to clear the screen, when in a tight situation.You have a Health Bar and can withstand a decent number of hits. Unfortunately, since you can't repair (not even between levels), you die fairly quickly, most of the time.There are several waves of enemies (some with 3, 4, 5, etc.) and isolated enemies. When you manage to defeat a full wave before they leave the screen, they drop a coin, which gives you more $$. You also get a smaller amount of $$ per successful hit.Some enemies shoot in front, some have lasers with a slow recharge, some shot directly at you (although their bullets are destructible), and others are simply large, tanky enemies. I didn't get to feel overwhelmed, per se, since you don't have to destroy every enemy, as they leave the screen after a few seconds.I'm not sure how many more enemies there are, since I didn't get very far. Regardless, there doesn't seem to be very much variety.Other than that, there's a Target Practice section at the end of a nivel. Several target travel uniformely on the screen. Your job is to shoot them (from red to green), so that they leave the screen with a green color. In the end, you're given some money, depending on your performance.There are a few other points I want to touch on.This is an horizontal shooter, set in a vertical planeI never even thought about it, despite being obvious. Making an horizontal shooter in a vertical plane is an awful idea! I mean, if makes it much harder to reach enemies, and give you much lesser time to think about where to go and what to shoot. Overall, it's a bad idea. They could have simply made it a vertical shooter, but I guess the filmed level would have to be longer, which may have created issues for them...Score vs. UpgradesYour score is calculated on the amount of money you have, which means that you have to choose between upgrading, and just keeping your score. The upgrades get increasingly more expensive as well. The thing is, the upgrades are so minimal, that it's almost set in stone that you'll do much better by simply keeping your money. As it is, it makes the game even more repetitive.I like the idea, but it doesn't seem very finely tuned.Very bland mechanicsThis is another big issue. You shoot your cannons if front (left and right, alternated) and occasionally some missiles. The upgrades simply increase your rate of fire. There's nothing else to it... It's way too barebones, for me. There could be powerups, or perhaps different weapons to keep the variety up a bit more, but there's nothing.Maybe some people are into that, but I thought the game got stale too quickly, for me.I don't think there's much more to say. It works, more or less, but provides nothing noteworthy as a game. This was clearly a sideproject for the team, focusing more on the fun of making it than the experience and game as a whole. And to be honest... that's fine. It's good that some companies do that, but wait for a sale.Just know what you're getting into!",

        "text": "ContextOver the Void is more of an atmospheric art piece than a game. You have several levels to explore, with a few game elements to guide you through them. You also have a somewhat free movement to complement it all.Overall, I don't think it succeeds as a game, but is certainly a very nice experience. If you want something to simply jump into and be immersed in, I think this is very good!You'll navigate a very expressionist world, with huge, abstract architecture, all backed up by a very nice and soothing electronic soundtrack. If this sounds good to you, give it a go!I've taken one hour in my first play-through, and about half of that on my second. It's short, but it's the type of platform that you can easily revisit just to relax and look around, if you're into that.PresentationThis is undoubtedly the most important aspect of the game. This is something you play for the audio-visual experience, and not for the challenge or the story. So, how exactly does it compell the player?Well, looking at the screenshots, you can have a very good idea of it. It looks amazing! It uses shape and color in a very unique way, and the scale makes you feel tiny, in a good way. Just moving around feels good, in this game.It's not without its faults, however. I have a relatively small complaint just regarding the visuals:Levels feel a bit inconsistentThe first few levels take a very simplistic stance, but one that makes each level feel very unique and gives off a completely different vibe. Later levels, however, feel a bit too full, regarding both the colors, geometry, and particles effects. Those levels still look very good, don't get me wrong, but they're not quite as astonishing and the first ones.Regarding the music and sound-effects, I have a similar perspective. First off, they fit the overall experience very well, and are certainly pleasant to the ear. I'm not into electronic music, for the most part, but I still enjoyed this a great deal. A very nice detail of how the sound ties with the visuals, is the way some of the objects and particle effects pulse with the music, as well as your jumps emit a fitting sound-effect. Neatly done, so far.I do have a problem with the sound design, however. While it may seem very minor, I think it makes a big impact on the experience, but is also easily fixed.Pausing in the musics breaks the flow of the gameBoth upon dying, and finishing a level, the music completely stops. In a game about immersing yourself in the levels it creates an unwelcome dissonance, in my opinion. When you die, the music of the level simply restarts. When finishing a level, the music stops, and a new song starts on the next nevel, which loads very fast, without a loading screen (a way of loading that would contribute to the immersion, if not for the music).There are as many games that fall into this as there are those who overcome this issue. FTL, the Bit Trip Series, Thomas Was Alone, and even Super Meat Boy are but examples of how to do it well. Making music flow continuously is fairly easy to do and does wonders to the game, in my opinion! Regardless of the issues that I point out, I think that the game is definitely worth playing for the presentation alone. It's not perfect, but I find it unique, and more games are certainly welcome to improve this style.General StructureNow, I'll look at Over the Void as a game. As I said, the you go through various level, all with the same objective: opening the void to progress to the next level. You do it by pressing buttons throughout the stages. There's no story or objectives for you to complete, necessarily, and each level is self-contained.You also have a counter on the top right of the screen, with x/50. This refers to several Orbs spread around the levels (in this case, not self-contained). They serve absolutely no purpose that I saw, aside from being yet another way of guiding you through the beautiful levels. I've also ended up with 51/50.As far as I can see, the game elements are very artificial, serving as a vehicle for the player to look at the environment. Take that as you will.Another issue (which isn't crucial, but would have benefitted the game if it had been done differently) is the lack of an ending altogether. I realize that there's no build-up to it, per se, but the last level simply leads to the credits screen without any kind of aknowledgement of the player's actions. I would have enjoyed something like what Antichamber did, even. Just a small animated section, some little detail about The Void. There's nothing. It's fine, but the addition would make it more charming, in my opinion.Movement and General GameplayNow that you have an idea of what to do, here's how to do it.You can walk, jump (pretty high) and create 2 types of platforms: solid, and bouncy. These platforms disappear as you go away from them, or when you press K to destroy them all. Basically, you simply place these platforms in front, or under you, and you go everywhere you want. The game's gravity isn't too strong, giving the player more liberty. It also features more vertical gameplay than horizontal. About 95% of the time, you'll be moving through your own platforms, rather than using the game's structures.Aside from this, there are 2 hazards, so to speak. One, is air bubbles that push you up, slowly, and the other is downwards wind, to push you down strongly.It tries a bit too hard to be considered a gamePersonally, these 2 shouldn't be there at all. Yet another \"game element\" that doesn't seem to have been thought out from the beginning, but as a way of making Over the Void a \"game\". The biggest problem I have with it, is the way it tries to feel more like a game, but being rather unsuccessful. You die when you go off the limits of the level (sometimes too high, altough it's rare, as you're mostly confined), or going into the void (or water) below you. The air bubbles serve more as an aid, and are there to change up your movement feeling. The wind, is there to kill you, and increase the challenge. However, this challenge comes more as an annoyance, as it doesn't add to the overall experience. You'll simply have to use your platforms to go around it... Meh.How the level design could have gone hand in hand with the art...As I've said, the game elements feel forced. But there was a way of taking the strong point of games AND the twisted architecture and make it into one cohesive experience.This is a 3D platformer. And some parts of the levels work pretty well for you player to walk around and jump from one point to another (although not for anything significant - you can jump around a bit, but it never leads anywhere). But since you always have access to platforms, it's much easier to navigate that way. With more work and thought put into it, you could use the twisting architecture as platforms, and have the player work through it to reach a given button. There, it would be easier to integrate the hazards into the level design, and have it fit well. Some parts the player would float to reach higher places, while trying to avoid the strong winds.That would require a whole redesign of a game, which isn't to be expected, of course. Just brainstorming, here.Constantly looking down is also a downside to it. Exploration and Navigation are almost mutually exclusive.Aside from these, the games works well, for me most part. It has a few technical issues like getting stuck between platforms, some visual clipping, the game not responding after you Alt-Tab, and also a major lag issue in the second level (only). These are all easy to ignore, though, in favor of the beautiful environments! This review may seem too negative, but I enjoyed it a lot! Please, take it as constructive criticism. Try it!",

        "text": "Chip is a logic puzzle game that is very much focused on efficiency. Finishing a level isn't in question; instead, you are timed, your moves are counted, and there are some extra collectables in some of the levels.It also another component of customization. There are 3 characters, with several slots for cosmetic items. You buy these with in-game money that you get from completing the levels. It doesn't affect the game at all, it's simply a mechanism to give the player a goal.As I've been trying to do recently, I'll try to break the review into sections, instead of describing the whole game and its problems all at once.Audio-Visual DesignNot much to say in here.  Its interface is a bit iOS-y, with big buttons, and the controls relying only on clicking and dragging. I'll get into the controls later, but the rest works fine for what it is.(1)I liked the cartoon-y style, with bold lines and clean colors. Nice job on that.The music also started out to my liking, but there isn't enough variety, and quickly got repetitive. General StructureThere are 4 worlds, each with its new mechanics. The first 3 worlds have 20 levels each (with additional 5 challenge levels). The last one seemed to have been added after the game's release, featuring only 5 levels.Each level has 3 stars, one for the timed element, one for the number of moves, and one for simply finishing it. Leaderboards are only present for your overall score. Additionally, some levels have a bag of money, or a cosmetic piece for you to collect. You get gold as you progress, and can then spend it on the shop. You can buy headgear, dresses, boots, etc. to use in each character. These are only visible in the starting screen, and in the level. The objective is to get an energy ball to the your character, and the character appears as you've customized.It's more of a distraction than a mechanic, but hey, it's cool that it's there, I'm sure there are people who appreciate those details a lot.General MechanicsYou can always see the whole level in the screen at once. Unfortunately, there's no zooming option, which could solve lots of problems. But more on that later. (2)The level effectively starts when you do your first move. The puzzles consist on shooting an energy ball in a certain direction, and then move objects around to alter the balls trajectory. There are object that reflect the energy ball, portals, magnets, etc. etc. There are many different elements at play, but they're well introduced and don't overwhelm you. Tutorialisation was one of the highlights of this game, for me, but not without its problems.(3)You can rotate and/or move some objects. For example, there's a wall that reflect the energy ball. However, if it's not the right angle, the ball is simply destroyed, or sent in a direction that you didn't want it to. Or, when starting the level, you may want to shoot the ball into a different direction. Rotation and Movement are level dependent.There's no point in explaining details here, just trying to give you an idea.Every object is already placed within the level when you start. It doesn't ask you to construct the level to solve the puzzle. Everything is placed, and you have to play accordingly.It's a bit limiting, but that's due to the game's (valid) design. If you don't like that type of puzzle, you're better off looking elsewhere.Alright, onto the major design problems/highlights.1.ControlsThis is probably the biggest issue with Chip. You click an object to select it, and hold if you want to rotate it, or click another tile to move it. The problem is that the hitboxes are very dodgy. Part of it is due to the isometric perspective, and part of it is due to its size. I've had to restart levels countless times because I wanted to move and ended up selecting another object, or rotated it the wrong way. The alternative controls scheme helps, by moving the camera with RMB. The main has movement AND the camera tied to LMB which aggravates every control problems. It's particularly bad in levels cluttered with objects.Another huge problem with bad controls, is the efficiency in the level design. Since you are always timed, and your moves are counted, it's too easy to screw up, without it being the player's fault.The game is not pausable, although there is a slow-down when you have a object selected. It's not enough. They wanted to make a real-time, reflex based puzzle game, and sort of hammered it in, trying not to compromise that initial vision.A zoom featured could have helped with the hitboxes, I feel. The closer you are, the more precise the movement is, and could lead to fewer screwups.2.Time ElementsThere are two elements of time in Chip. One of them, is the time limit for each level. The other, is how sequencial your actions are. You'll have to move and rotate the same object several times, depending on which sections the ball is, and also have to coordinate every move to achieve each star. This could be great, but there are several reasons why they fall apart.Again, it seems like they wanted to make a game reliant on being fast and efficient, but didn't quite know how to do it properly, hence making those mechanics very artificial.The solutions rely more on reflexes than logic, sometimes. You can often see how to finish the levels, but end up failing because of the controls. Also, creating a time limit makes no sense to me, in such a game. There's usually only one solutions, and the creative side of the game is so low, that having it timed doesn't really help. Besides, it is often impossible to get the moves star and the time star at once. That's right. You'll have to replay the levels to get them separately...I don't think it the real-time element should be present at all, as it doesn't enhance the experience in any way. Plus the clunky controls, it's a nightmare.A simple pause would do this game wonders! Time the levels as you want, but make it count only when things are moving. The slowing down helps, but it doesn't quite reach it, and it's just there to stay \"true\" to the initial design, which doesn't work. If the player paused the game when moving an object, it would certainly feel much better.3.TutorializationThe game isn't awful. Despite having critical problems, it has some very elegant design as well!How it teaches the player is one of those features. It progressively introduces mechanics, one by one, and has a couple of levels that focus on teaching the player. Those are easy, but often lead the player in the right direction to beat the following levels, that are a bit more complex.For the most part of the game, levels didn't overwhelm me, and the solutions were spot-on! Later on, it all crashes, as you need to get each star separately, there are many objects close together, the previous 6-7 moves are now 30, etc.Another detail, is regarding moves and the tutorials/subsequent level design. The moves counter is supposedly optimized. However, in some levels, you can do better (which feels good, of course!) by hitting the ball while the object is moving towards the next position. It's like hitting two birds with one stone. That particular detail is almost tutorialized early on. There was a level that couldn't be beaten with all the stars without this trick. If that is the case, one would expect them to follow with it, and take that into all of the levels' design.  They don't. I realize that this is a very minor gripe, but it's one of those details that stick out, to me. And this mechanic made some levels really satisfying too!Well, I'm out of characters.. I was positively surprised at first! Unfortunately, when the difficulty ramps up, the game falls apart and every problem becomes too evident. I can't recommend it, but it has potential!",

        "text": "ContextGone Home is an interesting game, that tries to make a full game out of Bioshock's characteristic environmental story-telling. Made by some of the same people, it simply tells the player the story of a 90s family, with a focus on a tennager's social/emotional life.To achieve that, the game uses everything at its disposal to display the scenery in a way that feels natural, and as if you were back in that era. I'll say that this was very well made, and I believe that they've achieved what they intended, for the most part. The overall experience, however, may not have quite hit the mark, for some people. I'll simply try to break it down to major points, as there is lots of different analysis on this game, due to its 2013 impact.Everyone seems to have taken a very personal stance with Gone Home, and many people have looked deeply into what meaning this game may have had, and claim that is what made it great. They also seem to overlook that many games employ this. They have subtle references and sidestories. However, since those aspects rarely get major attention, and few people look into that, it ends up being novel. Sometimes, it's not about the game itself, but the whole ambient created around them.There's a lot of different perspectives around it, and most were made by people far more intelligent and experienced than I am, and with a lot more research. But hey, this is just a game, and people look too closely into it, at times. I've beaten the game in 3 hours, with virtually everything explored, and spent the rest of the time alt-tabbed, reading reviews, and watching videos. Then, I took a week off of the game, and am now writing this review with a fresh-er mind.Anyway, that was just context! Here are some of my thoughts.General MechanicsGone Home is simply about exploring a house, mechanically. You pick up objects, rotate them looking for clues, read lots of notes, books, receipts, everything you can find, really. The only challenge present in the game is in the form of locked doors, or numbered-locks. You'll usually find the keys fairly close to where the lockpads are, and the doors are simply a way of guiding the player. I don't think it feels very forced. Or maybe that's my suspension of disbelief at work. Regardless, there isn't much to it, in way of mechanics and challenge. It's mostly reading, listening to diaries, and slowly piecing the different stories in your head.Un-realistic game elementsThis is a weird one to write about, since it did not affect me at all. However, since Gone Home is a game that doesn't focus on being a game, but a different way of telling a story, I have the impression that it will affect people who don't normally play video-games. This is simply put because they will not find it natural for these elements to be present.These elements are the locked doors, that seem to be locked arbitrarily, as a way of gating progress, and the most important one, how notes are literally everywhere.Notes are spread around all over the place, some being decades old, hence having no place under a bed, or in a table next to the telephone. Again, I can easily overlook this, but it is certainly a flaw when it tries to transcend video-games.Representing an eraNow, as I said, the game was set in the 90s, and felt like that 90s. And it does it in a very similar way to Bioshock, which I loved. That is, by representing the era with music cassettes, magazines, tv show posters, old VHS with recorded movies, etc. There's a whole lot of that. And the game is also well put together, in the sense that everything seems coherent with the tendencies of the time.It's a very nice way of presenting a setting, and I think they've certainly nailed it. The music cassettes were especially cool, since they were set up for you to find a play them in a room while you explored it.An ordinary story of family and teenage struggleThis is a highlight for many people, but a low point for me, personally. The stories revolve around a single family. It has marital issues, teenage emotional struggles, old parent relationships, the story of the house, etc. I really like the way its told, but I don't care. At all. Maybe I like empathy, but I couldn't care. The notes were very well placed and written, for the player to get the story bit by bit, without it feeling incoherent, or with too many words. However, it was simply not engaging to me. Contrast that with Bioshock's failed Utopias and progressions therein. Or Zeno Clash's strange worlds, Fallout, and I could go on...I like games (and books, series, etc.) that take me to new places, and ask some question that would never come in the real world. That's far more interesting to me. I can't be bothered with these mundane stories (sorry if I sound arrogant haha! It's not the intention), because it's not what I play games for. But this is very subjective, of course.Reliance on nostalgiaThis is a very important point I want to make. It's the 90s. Most of the positive reviews I've read/seen, were from people that were very aware of this era in their lives, and they related with the characters, as a result. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but it must be considered. I haven't lived the 90s, meaning that I had very little connection with the game. Sure, I had some very vague memories, but it's not the same. Overall, I think there's a lot of the game that is supported by that familiarity, and that's also why it's often hit or miss. It was well executed, but it's only going to be truly meaning-ful, for the people who are nostalgic about all of the references, and general ambience that Gone Home gives.How the game medium excells in pacingThis is also something I find important, and the game took full advantage of it. In a book, or a movie, there's hardly a time to think, without pausing it, especially in the latter. You're constantly receiving information, and need to process it instantly.Quite a bit that can be lost in this way.If you start thinking about a certain scene, you'll probably lose a few other pieces of dialogue or another scene, etc.With Gone Home, due to it being a game, there's a lot more time to process that information, and also to relate to it, without compromising. It's interactive, in more ways than are obvious. I'm not talking about stopping exploration to think about it. I mean the seconds you would otherwise lose between actions. Even between picking up a note and putting it back down. Perhaps turning on the light, or opening a door.  All of this could be wasted time. However, it's time for you to think about the new notes you've read. What could have happened? Why did the character think that way? How does that relate to you?This is a very nice aspect inherent to the pacing in video-games. You can have the information spread around, and still be able to easily connect everything while you're playing, without making any compromises. And Gone Home uses it neatly.MiscellaniaI think that's all I wanted to add to the discussion. Overall, I think it's an incomplete experience. What it tries to do, it does wonderfuly! However, I think it relies too much on its theme and touchy subjects to make an impression on the player. It's a one-trick poney. All it does, is to apply the concept of environmental story-telling.There's also very little interactivity. You're merely a witness. You never actually do anything. And there were opportunities for that. Some scenes that look like the player could interact with a discover some neat secrets. Nope. None of that, missed opportunity.I was interesting to play, and read around it. For 20$, though, no, unless you want a different take on games, regardless of the 10/10s. If you just want something to play, this is definitely not for you.",

        "text": "   Claire is a 2D low-fi horror game that relies heavily on scenery and atmosphere, and not jumpscares or horrifying imagery. Unfortunately, due to its nature, Lone Survivor comparisons are inevitable, and I think this game has less of an impact because of that exact reason. (I have seen people stating that the horror from both of these games borrows a lot from Silent Hill, but I have yet to play those)   I enjoyed this game quite a lot, but it certainly isn't flawless, design-wise. I'll discuss important points later, and just give you a general overview of how the game works.   I'll try to give a short overview of the game. Regarding other 2D, low-pixel horror games, Lone Survivor and Home spring to my mind. This is far closer to LS than Home, but with fewer interesting mechanics, and certainly has a more streamlined story (leaving a few unanswered questions regardless).   You play as Claire, and you don't know exactly where you are, despite the familiarity of the places you visit. There's always something wrong. Your job is to piece all the memories revealed to you with the symbolism present in order to find why you're there and more important, if you deserve to leave. The narrative is well put together, it was pretty interesting to me! Visual and Audio Design   As I said, it's very low-fi, but in a good way! Just like the previous games mentioned, the game gives you an outline for how the sceneries look, and let your mind take care of the little details. Overall, I think it looks really good. Besides, it also features modern lighting effects that give this game an edge over many retro looking games.   The sound-effects are also very raw and disturbing, and it's where I find the biggest similarities with LS. There's a lot of static noise, rather than the usual screaming. However, while LS did come as a surprise to me, this didn't felt quite as unique (although, I'm not trying to take credit away from this game, only talking about my subjective perception). Both the visual and the audio design fits together very nicely, and creates the kind of disturbing and uncomfortable horror that I like. Overall mechanics   Your character has both Health and Fear, both of which can be replenished with different consumables. As excepted, enemies and disturbing places will make you more fearful, and may even decrease your health if you're on the verge of sanity. When enemies attack you, you also lose health. Scavenging for consumables is important, especially because you can not kill enemies, only run away from them. Literally. Stealth is almost inexistent, but I'll detail it later on.(1)   You have a lighter (that lights a small radius around you), and you later get a Flashlight, that consumes batteries, but it's more potent, and can also illuminate where you point with the mouse. This is a pretty cool feature, but it also carries some minor problems.(2)   Enemies can follow you through rooms by destroying doors (the first times takes a while, but after that, they're pretty fast to change rooms). When you're spotted, your best bet is to run away, and try to loose them. You can do it by changing to a room twice without them seeing you, or hide in closets while they're breaking down the door. While it works, for the most part, not being able to attack them can be frustrating, especially when you're at low HP. This leaves less room to explore as well.   Around the places, you can find Notes (written by someone close to you) that may hint at why you're there and what it is. You may also find some people, that may even be more lost that you do. Each of them brings a different perspective on life, based on their own situation. I found these to be pretty nice, and they also added some interesting bits to the game's \"message\" and narrative.   Other than that, there are also some puzzles. This are half great, half poor. Some of them simply depend on environmental clues and are fairly easy, if you pay attention. These rely on clues around that particular puzzle, and not ones that you may or may not have found 3 hours before. This makes for good pacing!   Others, are more reliant on riddles. While they were cool, they were also a bit too ambiguous. After I knew the solution, I could see it made sense, but there were also other equally valid possibilities... That was not so good. I liked the idea, but I don't think the execution was quite there.    Regardless, these puzzles are far apart, and there are not a lot. They're there to change pacing, and they do just that pretty well.   I'll try to go into some details now. 1. Saving and Map Systems   I've found some problems with these. There are safe rooms spread around the maps, where you can save. There's no other kind of checkpoints, it's all manual and only in certain rooms. This could be fine, but I didn't like it very much.   As I've mentioned, the maps are very maze-like in their construction. There are lots of locked doors, doors that only open from one side, crawlspaces, etc. While the \"blocked\" doors are marked on the map after you try to open them, it's still very messy. Each map is a bit too cluttered, which is a problem when you're trying to explore everything.  I know that being lost can be a pretty crucial part to horror, but it's hard to couple that with exploration. All the notes, people, butterflies, etc. that you collect do affect the ending, despite being optional. The endings are determined by your overall attention to detail. But I digress.   Add to this, the fact that you can't kill nor avoid enemies. And Sprinting has a cooldown (as expected). If you find an unexpected enemy, you'll simply run, and try to enter the closest door. This is a recepy to get lost in 5 seconds. The map marks visitted rooms, which is good, and you can get back to where you were, but now knowing that there's an enemy waiting for you. Later on, it's also easy to run from one enemy and bump into another, and end up 7 rooms away from where you wanted to be, with a few more collectables and low HP. After this, it's very easy to die, especially if an enemy happens to be at a door where you enter a room.    It's a bit convoluted, sorry, but this is how I felt. It got messy. And the biggest problem was to get the progress gone when you died. The safe rooms aren't too far between, but were enough for it to be frustrating when going for the collectibles, for which you need to explore every corner.   This is also tied to the fact that enemies can't be beaten, and rarely avoided without taking damage. Later on, the maps get more confusing (intentionally so, which was part awesome, part annoying), so this problem aggravates itself.   I think it's just a problem tied to making the game focus on Exploration and Tension at the same time, two almost paradoxical concepts. 2. Mouse controlled Flashlight   This is very minor, but worth noting nonetheless. The flashlight is the only thing you need the mouse to control in this game. Literally the only thing. When you're walking with the lighter only, the result is a mouse pointer on the screen. Oops, there goes immersion.    I think that it is a cool mechanic, but it would have been much better if the game featured other mouse-driven mechanics, even if they were very minor.  3. Invincible Enemies   I'll tackle this again quickly. Enemies are far scarier if you feel defenseless, certainly! However, the player should never be this defenseless, just for the fact that it hinders the gameplay, at times where the tension is low. I think that LS avoided this problem very elegantly. You were hopeless if an enemy surprised you, you were hopeless and had to run. Otherwise, you could attract them with meat, and then stealthily avoid them.   Even if not unique, Claire is well put together, and features good psych-horror! ",

        "text": "  Betrayer is a weird beast. It's another game that holds its narrative higher than its gameplay, but it still tries to fit more combat into its story and atmosphere than other games like Gone Home, Master Reboot, etc.  It also features a very striking artstyle at first, although I'm not quite sure the developers knew exactly where they wanted to go with it.    You arrive in 17th century America, and go from camp to camp, trying to figure out the world around you. To do this, there are some pages spread around the maps, and also ghosts. You can see and speak to them, and little by little, by finding clues around the maps, you'll be able to understand who they are, how they died, and thus investigate the strange happening of each camp.   I really like the concept, and it's certainly different, but I don't think the execution is perfect, for the game's length. It feels like it would be a great element in a game, but not the sole focus, as is.   There are various enemies spread around, with different tells. You'll have to be methodical in dealing with them, and use sound to your advantage, moving stealthily to avoid certain death.   Let's go more in-depth with its presentation. You've probably seen from the screenshots that it's a very important aspect of this game.   The game is essentially in greyscale, with heavy contrast and lighting, and then features some live red for you to spot enemies and other important clues. There is the option to set normal colors though, and it looks pretty good as well, as long as you adjust the contrast and the lighting as well.   There are two worlds, a living world, and the ghost world, which you switch from and to, depending on your objective. The ghost world is far grimmer and darker. However, since both are black and white, I think it loses its punch, in general. I played the whole game as it was by default (always greyscale). After that, I went back to find missing collectibles, and used normal colors. Even in the living world, the game is far more tense with colors off, but the shock in switching worlds is significantly lessened.   Playing without colors can also be quite confusing at first, and I honestly don't know how I feel about it. It's just weird. And in the context of this game, it works! The whole time, I was just trying to understand what exactly the game was trying to do.   Another crucial aspect on this game is its sound design. There's no music, it's only ambient sounds.Now, the greyscale serves a purpose in the game. It makes you realize that you see the world differently than others in that world. You can clearly see enemies and interactable objects, while they can not. This also plays a role in sound design, as enemies have a much harder time seeing how. They can however, hear you if you're not careful. So you'll constantly be trying to walk crouched if you hear enemies around (or see them) not to get spotted. There are also occasional gusts of wind that mask your sprinting sound.   Some enemies are very clear with their red tells. Others, however, are also hidden, until they spot you. The only way for you to tell they're around, is through the sounds they make. There's a lot of nuance to it regarding its sound and visual design and the combat, actually, it's pretty cool.   There are also audio tells for when you are near an objective, or a collectible. You can also press X to be guided towards a close ghost/main objective, with a distant sound effect. There is a visual aid to it in the options menu, but I recommend playing only based on the audio cues.   It's hard to review this game, as it has so many details that shape the experience. I'll have to say the it's very heavy on atmosphere. It's not an horror game, but it can make you uncomfortable at times, and unexpected enemies can make you jump every once in a while. But I loved how tense it made me. The visual and audio design was spot on to make you feel that something was wrong at all times. Great job on that.Well, there goes half of the review and I haven't began talking about gameplay.Each map if self contained, and you can only progress to one after you've done every important objective for the previous. If you guide yourself with the sound cues, you'll have no problem with it. Most of the maps are very empty and barren woods, with 2-3 camps or important landmarks in each one. There are Pages, Chests, Clues, Ghosts, Graves, and Totems spread around. You have a notebook that checks most of what you find, regarding clues, locations visitted, graves found, etc. You also have a map to guide you (and fast travel between landmarks), but you can not make annotation in the map. This is a huge problem. If you're after the chests, pages and clues, it's a nightmare to go look for them again without map markers. There are also some clues that you can't uncover until you get a Shovel late into the game. Without marking these when you find them, going back after you get it is a pain... You'll forget most of them, and overall, it's very inconvenient to simply walk around hoping you'll stumble into something. This is only a problem with the optional stuff, but it's annoying nonetheless.    Regardless, let's go back to the game. There's also a vendor, from whom you can buy weapons, ammo, and the like. Enemies also drop weapons, although much weaker than the ones you get from the vendor. There are also 16 unique weapons that you can find from Chests, or with the Shovel. These are even better from the ones in the vendor, and it's worth scavenging for them.    In the normal world, you'll have to clear the camps of Spaniards (to set your checkpoint there) and find a Bell, to mount in it. By ringing the bell you change worlds. This is where it gets more interesting.   In the ghost world, you'll go around trying to find lost souls and wraiths. There can be both colonizers and natives. If they're lost, you'll point them to the camp, you can speak to them there. As you find more ghost and clues for each map, you'll be able to ask them questions about each other, and the items you find. This reveals how they died, little by little. It's usually episodes of people betraying one another (hence the name). While they're not groundbreaking, I thought they were cool, and also set the tone for the game's world. It's not historical or anything. It's mostly a way of integrating the narrative with the gameplay, and that's very good.   There's also a main plot (that's related with these side-stories as well), about the normal human being you find. She can't quite remember what happened, and so you go around trying to find her family.   The problem with this, is that I can't understand the point of this story. There doesn't seem to be a message in it, for the most part. It's just... there. And while the world itself, and the side-stories make the game interesting, it doesn't seem as directed as I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed playing the game, but there's something missing, and the potential is there!  I hope you get a good enough idea from this to know if this is for you. I just find it really hard to fit this game into a review.   Another aspect that I want to touch, is the moral of your actions. With the enemies, they completely dehumanized the enemies, weirdly enough. The Spaniards are just armored humanoids that sound like bears. Seriously, if you hear a freakin' bear, it's a Spaniard. They also have a full helmet, so you never see their face. The natives are fire-y ashen being and whistle to communicate with each other. None of them feel actually human, so you have no problem with killing them, as they're just hostile beasts.   Overall, it's a very interesting game. Execution is half stellar, half lacking. It feels a bit incomplete, pacing-wise. But I'd say give it a go! You'll probably have an odd feeling of enjoyment while playing it!",

        "text": "   Gigantic Army is a 2D sidescrolling shooter that stays very true to the old NES style of games, not just in its presentation, but also in principle. While it doesn't do anything innovative, it's very competent at what it tries to do, and will certainly satisfy you if you're into this \"retro\" movement.   This game rewards flawless play and is very punishing if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. As it is a Mech game, movement is slow and methodical, and you need to think before acting, since you can't quickly move or stop any action. Presentation.   To be honest, while I recognize that it's trying to look \"retro\", I don't like the way this looks at all. It's very colorless, the low resolution doesn't scale at all and it's very rough around the edges. It was made by only two people, if I'm not mistaken, but overall, I think it looks pretty poor. The enemies and Bosses look pretty cool, though, but the backgrounds' color and textures leave a lot to be desired...   But hey, it does look old, if that's what they were going for. Instrusion 2, for example, looked much tighter. Or Bleed(even though I didn't like the aesthetic very much), for example.   There's too much green/brown to my taste.    The Music is an interesting aspect. While I don't think it's very good, I think it totally fits the balls to the wall mech combat typical of the 90s. Very strong bass, actually! It sounds a bit amateur and doesn't really pack a punch, but I still appreciate it a lot for simply being there, weirdly enough, mostly for the feeling it manages to convey.   The SoundEffects, I found awful. They were very generic and repetitive, louder than everything else, and ended up being very annoying. There are sound options, but the sound-effects seemed to ignore the scale, and the only noticeable difference was between 0 and the rest.   Now, let's talk about the game itself and Mechanics.    There are 5 levels, and it wouldn't be an old-school game if you didn't have to beat all 5 of them with 3 continues, in one sitting. Oh yes. And you have a time limit per level! Granted, it's not a very long game (30-45 minutes, maybe?), but it's pretty challenging to do it nonetheless. Also, each time you die and use a continue, you'll start from the beginning of the level, with your score reset and lose all the power-ups (but regenerate life and shield).   You first start with 2 difficulties unlocked, Easy and Normal. You can unlock Hard by beating Normal, and Insane by beating Hard. I'll talk more about the difficulty changes later.   Aside from difficulty unlocking, each run is self contained. There's no progression at all outside each run. And inside them it's just tied to weapon power-ups and score.   When you start a game, you pick your difficulty, and then have a choice for a primary and secondary weapon. There are 3 of each, one of each tier. The primary weapon has infinite ammo, but the higher tier you pick, the less ammo you'll have for your secondary weapon. PW are an Assault Rifle, and Spread Shotgun, and a Grenade Launcher. SW include a Frag Grenade, a Missile Barrage, or a Single Laser Beam from freakin' Hell. No bias towards the beam at all, here.   For example, with the Assault Rifle you'll have 3 Beams, with the Spread Gun you'll have 2 Beams, and with the Grenade launcher you'll only get one Beam. This number is per level. When you beat a stage, your weapon will recharge.   Once you pick them, you'll have to stick with these weapons.   Your mech has an Health Bar, a Shield Bar and an Energy Bar. You can use the shield only when not moving/shooting, and each time you defend against something, the bar lowers. If it reaches its limit, you'll lose the shield for the remainder of the stage. Your Energy is consumed when you use the jetpack, but it recharges quickly. These two aspects are essential for you to plan whether to dodge and keep shooting, or simply defend, playing safely.    Killing enemies simply grants you Score, but there are crates throughout the stages that drop Health, Time, and Power. Power upgrades your main weapon (more damage, rate of fire, etc.), but you'll lose it when you get hit. Remember when I said it punished you? Yeah. Not getting hit will make you even more powerful, making this a very methodical game.   Aside from this, it's a basic shooter. Enemy variety is pretty good, and there are 1-2 mini Bosses per level, with a bigger Boss at the end. Everything has a pattern that you have to learn to master this game. And if you're into this kinds of games, you'll certainly enjoy beating the game several times with different loadouts and difficulties. The achievements are here to reward you for beating the game with high scores, without using continues and so on. It also encourages trying different weapons, and hints at secrets, so I have nothing to complain there.   Now, about the difficulty. What I wanted to say, and it is something I highly appreciate, is that difficulty isn't tied to numbers, in Gigantic Army. Higher difficulties change enemy behaviors, and even introduce new enemies. This is really good design, in my opinion, and something that I rarely see. Playing on Hard doesn't just make you be more careful, but actually changes your strategy, since the patterns are harder.   Personally, I enjoy these games a lot, but I prefer faster gameplay, rather than the slow mech. This isn't a fault of the game, though, as it achieves exactly what it sets out to do, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you like fast gameplay, you won't find it in here. The game is sluggish, intentionally so.   Also, the game feels a bit dated, from a design standpoint. It's designed with the old-school mindset, and while it worked before, it doesn't stand quite as well, nowadays. This is regarding the lack of progression, and there being only 6 weapons in total. The game Bleed did things differently, in which you could get upgrades, and more weapons (that were VERY different from one another) outside of the levels, and thus gave it more replayability. The game also focused more on reflexes, and movement had more depth to it, in my opinion. But I digress.   Those weapons only hold my attention for so long, it would be cool to have more, and even unlock some. Another issue, it tied to beating the game with limit continues, and in one go. I think the developers should give players the option to save. Keep the achievements for beating it without continues and perhaps without saving, but not everyone is into that. So just put that option in there, why not?   I believe the game would benefit from these more \"modern\" option, especially for audiences who aren't that familiar or fond of old games. And options wouldn't hurt, would they? Well, this is just my view, but it's not a very big issue at all.   I think I've covered everything I wanted to talk about. Even though it didn't hold me for too long, I think this game is pretty good. Limited, sure, but I think it does exactly what it wants to do, and it does that very well. It's not a game of mass appeal, but if it seems like your kind of game, give it a go, you won't be disappointed!",

        "text": "   Our Darker Purpose is yet another entry in the rogue-lite genre. This one seems to take the same starting point as The Binding of Isaac, and steering the game towards another direction entirely.    What I mean by this is that takes a very similar formula (a randomly generated Zelda-like dungeon with bosses, \"shops\" and items), but focuses on different aspects. While TBoI was a more visceral and kept item effects to more mysterious (not a lot of detailed description and stats), Our Darker Purpose tries to take things more precise in terms of gameplay, making the runs longer and significantly more difficult, and embelishes it with a fully fleshed lore as well as permanent progression.   Unfortunately, it's a very tall order to beat. Taking the same genre but opposite design choices isn't always the best option. In this case, while I can see some people having a great time with this game, I can't say that I've enjoyed it nearly as much as the TBoI.   I can't write a full review on a game like this, since the details are the secrets to this genre. If you're not very familiar with Binding of Isaac, I can't guarantee that you'll understand my points. Sorry if that's the case.   First off, presentation. In this game, presentation is one of the highlights, and certainly something that took the developer's focus. It has a very gothic, Tim Burton-esque feel to it. While it may be a bit rough around the edges, it's pretty awesome in this regard. Everything seems to work towards delivering the same feeling, and it succeeds in doing so. From the music to the artstyle and the backstory, it is definitely very solid.   Each Boss has a lore that you're told about after beating them, there are achievements to be unlocked (in-game only) that also give you even more story about them, etc. Everything you do seems to have a bit of story attached to it, which is good, if that's what you're looking for. If you're a purely mechanical player in these kinds of game (which is totally understandable), it may not matter as much, but it's still good that it's there.   One problem I have with it, is that it is not very subtle, for the most part. Lore is usually presented through full pages of text that require you to stop playing to read them... On the other hand, the furniture also talk to each other! After you finish a room, there's a chance that the tables and chairs will start talking, revealing a bit more of the game's dark humour. Later on, however, you'll be trying to beat the game rather than patiently waiting for them to stop talking to resume your gameplay so, while I like what they were trying to do, I don't think it worked particularly well.   I can't divide this very well, so I'm just going to mention topics that come to mind about main differences to other games in the genre (and what makes them/this more fun).   Floors are, as expected, randomly generated. In this, however, the algorithm had some problems, as adjacent rooms rarely had a connection (aside from the one exit/entrance). In each floor you have normal enemies, a secret room chance, a vending machine, a Boss fight, and possibly Elite enemies. Normal enemies may drop Health/Chalk consumables or money. The vending machines may also have consumables, or items for you to buy, both passive or active.   The Boss fight rewards you with XP only, but not an item. To counter this, Elite enemies always drop an item. There are also some environmental hazard rooms with a chest in them. Some are hard to reach, while others are locked for a given time, and you have to try and survive during that time. Chests also contain items.   Only very cool aspect, is that every floor has a twist to it. When you finish one, you're given choices of several random floors, and you're given some information about them. The most important, is floor modifiers. Some are very dark but provide discounts (or more XP), some have more Elites, others guarantee you a secret room, some have 2 vendings machines, some have none, but give you more money, etc. etc. There are a bunch of them that you'll encounters, and their effects are not 100% clear at first. It provides another source of variety in playstyle nonetheless, once you get the hang of it.   One of the main sources of power, is leveling up. You get XP by killing enemies (or getting some items that improve your gain, or level you up instantly) and with each level, you can choose one of two perks. These are also random (although I believe the pair is fixed. Two perks are often together, although you may get different choices, randomly).   Unlike many games in the genre, they're very clear about what they do. They give you +20damage, or 15% moving speed and more consumable drops, etc. In my opinion, it makes the game less fun. One of the great aspects of the genre , is experimentation. You get some cryptic items, but discover what they do with time. In here, it's all very... safe. It's mostly straight up upgrades, although some require you to sacrifice one attribute to gain other.   The most important aspect in this game that took my enjoyment out of it, was the fact that the items are not very fun at all. There aren't as many items as one would expect, and they don't change gameplay all that much. While some do (maybe create 2 shots when you're not moving, or slow projectiles near you, or discharge electricity near you), most of them are simply stat changes, and it makes the game feel very stale.    In say, TBoI, there are often items that change your run drastically, and many of them synergise unpredictably with one other, which oftens leads to some crazy runs that are really fun. In here, there's very little of that. Besides, due to the low number of items, every run ends up feeling very same-y, and you require the same items to succeed.   Another very important aspect, is how the game feels. You character feels very impotent. Shots are tiny, with huge rooms full of enemies, often with hazards that are much bigger and faster than you. You do have a roll ability, though, you allows you to walk faster, but not shoot (unless you had a certain perk -- more on that later).   While it may seem very intentional, the game doesn't benefit a lot from these details at all. Another problem, is how hitboxes are a bit too dodgy and don't match with the perspective. It's also a bit dodgy in other games of the genre, but it's especially noticeable here, and it doesn't feel right.    And lastly, regarding this, is how the movement and shooting feels. I'm sorry for bringing it up again, but look at TBoI (LOL). Tears travel faster when you're shooting in the direction that you're walking, and travel slower if you talk on the opposite directions. When you walk to the sides, it changes the angle AND speed. In Our Darker Purpose, there's no speed change, only angle. This doesn't seems that big of a problem, but you can't imagine how much worst the shots feel as a result! It's something I hadn't considered before, but it's really impactful. Vlambeer, for example, is known to make great feeling games, so that's something I'll need to dive into soon enough. But yeah, movement and shooting doesn't feel very good to play, unfortunately.   Only one last aspect I want to mention. The game features a permanent progression system. Completing floors awards you with credits, and completing achievements and chapters (groups of floors gated by a final boss) grant you Lessons.    You can use credits to donate to a character (and gain passive benefits), or buy Lessons. Lessons then require you to have periods (you get one per chapter) to activate them, and they also give you passive benefits, although you'll have to choose carefuly between them. These have the ability to change your game quite a bit and give you some headstart.   In this game, this is a good thing, because it would be even more nightmarishly difficult without it.",

        "text": "   The Culling of the Cows stands between Plants Versus Zombies (Or old farmer vs zombie cows -- and possibly nazi aliens) and a sidescrolling shooter.   This is made by Decaying Logic, the same developers that brought us Radical Roach, which I reviewed a while ago (and was not impressed at all).   While I believe this is definitely an improvement over Radical Roach, many of the same flaws and design choices are present in this game, just to a lesser extent.    As usual, I'll start with presentation.   Not unlike their previous game, the Artstyle is probably one of the defining points. While it feels like flash, the animations are pretty good, although a bit too limited (there is only one animation for each enemy, it seems, as well as the carcass sprite, which makes the field end up looking a bit too monotonous).    The interface templates don't really seem to fit the theme, but it's not too bad. Other visuals effects are also subpar, against the cartoony style they were mostly going for.   There are a few different areas that slightly change the look of the map, but don't be fooled, as the map doesn't change at all, except for the visuals.   One problem I've had with it, is that the dead bodies cover up the screen by the end of the levels, to the point that you can't see new enemies arrive very clearly. That should definitely be changed. Other than that, it's fine.   The Music is also very similar to Radical Roach. It's not awful, and it has some good moments, but it's very repetitive, and doesn't loop very well, which is unfortunate. It's upbeat, and a mixture between some rock/metal and electronic music which goes for the more arcade vibe than atmosphere. There are some old sci-fi melodies though, which is a nice addition.    One improvement that I want to stress is that the music no longer restarts whenever you fail a level! It's a weird aspect to consider, but I think it's very important. It didn't happen in RR, and it was really annoying to listen the song start over and over again. Now, it doesn't happen, and it's a subtle but important improvement, in my opinion!   So, let's talk about the Mechanics.   As I said, it's has a bit of PvZ in it. Essentially, you have a large lane to defend agains the zombies. There are no specific lanes as in PvZ, you can freely walk around, and so can the enemies. You have a shotgun, different ammo types, upgrades, and assists. You'll also, periodically, be able to call for a crate with a random power-up.   Your job is to stop zombies from entering the barn, and also avoid being killed by them (if they hit you). Pretty straightforward.   You have a world map with the levels spread around (unlocking more as you go) with a couple of spreading paths, somewhat like One Finger Death Punch, only much smaller. These levels include a few different modes. There's Waves, in which, well, you fight waves of enemies, and there's a limit number of zombies that can enter the barn; Kill 'Em All, in which there's only one long wave and you can't let any zombie pass; Onslaught, in whichsome zombies can go through, but you have a machine gun (or a bazooka in one level) and shoot from the top of the barn, not worrying about dodging. And then, there's a couple of Boss levels.   The first two play essentially the same, with the exception that you can a few seconds to \"rest\" between waves. It had very, very little to the overall experience, but hey.   There's a significant number of different enemies, although a bunch of them are just faster or healthier versions of the previous. Still, it keeps the game interesting when starting out, since you need to change up your play a bit. Later on, new enemies stop coming, and every level becomes waay too similar (which is a feat in a 3 hour game).   There are also 3 badges to unlock in most levels -- these make the game harder, but they're barely there to reward you. There are some not to let any zombies pass, or not to miss any shot, but the others are simply about not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, etc. These do NOT make the game more fun at all. On the contrary, you're just shooting yourselves on the foot by limiting variety. It would certainly add challenge, but it's not very interesting challenge, in my opinion. But they're all optional, so it's fine. If you're into that, it exists. Overall, I'd say rethink your design on that.   Weapon upgrades are only on a level to level basis, and not persistent. You can increase the number of bullets, the number of bullets you reload at a time, add a laser to increase accuracy, or do something else that I'm not entirely sure of. I assumed it's reload speed.    Regarding ammo, you have Spread Shot, Explosive Shot, and Penetrating Shot. These do not stack, much to my disappointment. It could be really fun to have Spread Explosive Shots and just explode everything! But no... there are no synergies. If you purchase both, they'll alternate between them, from what I could tell.   Assists go from a chainsaw in the barn entrance to an AirStrike, or an Auto Machine Gun, for a few seconds. There are more to these, and they have a cooldown associated. I didn't use any of them, most of the time, because they weren't needed, nor particularly fun to use. You just press the button, and have the game made easier... But it's good that it's there, there's certainly room for different playstyles! Maybe you'd prefer not to upgrade your weapon as much, and focus on \"traps\", that's totally fine!   Ammo and Upgrades in-game cost money. And here's the big issue I have with it: You start each level with a certain amount. Then, by calling the random power-up, there's a chance you'll get a bit more, but it's generally not significant. So, you'll mostly upgrade your weapon at the start of the level, and then play with that. It's not dynamic at all, as every level played out pretty much the same to me. Sure, I could have forced myself to use different \"loadouts\", but the one I had worked for me, and the enemies didn't really require different tactics to be beaten. It would have been better to gain money over time, having waves get progressively more difficult, scaling with the upgrades you were able to buy!   Pacing is pretty much unexistant, unfortunately.   Well, maybe I'm being a bit too negative. The fact of the matter is that the game didn't do anything interesting to me. However, it was still somewhat fun for a bit. The kind of mindless fun you need to just pass time. You'll fight dozens of enemies per level, making each field become just a bunch of bloody cows on the ground. It's dumb, but it's somewhat enjoyable. Just not very interesting... Take One Finger Death Punch, for instance. That game is totally mindless fun! But it's far more interesting. First, it's very rhythmical, and you need to be in the \"zone\" to identify which enemies require which clicks to perfectly complete a level. And there are many different weapon that actually *feel* different, and make you look like a badass, cutting everyone up. I realize that these are two different games, but they both go for a similar feeling, that's why I'm bringing it up.   One aspect I enjoyed quite a lot was the last Boss. That was a pretty fun fight. Even though it had no upgrades or anything, the 3 phases complemented each other pretty well, and while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating to me. It should have had a few more boss fights, would definitely make the game more interesting.That's enough rambling. For the price, I can't recommend it at all. But if this seems appealing to you, give it a shot if the price drops. While I've beaten it in 3 hours, you can get a bit more out of it, if you go for the badges. And the developers seem to update the game from time to time, so it may get better. Overall, not awful, but not particularly good either.",

        "text": "   Noir Syndrome is an interesting game. It tries to bring in something new to the Rogue-lite market, by putting you in the shoes of a private detective. From there, you have several places to visit to gather clues and suspects, while trying not to step on the wrong faction's toes.   While the concept is fantastic, the game's scope is much more modest. I was expecting much more from it, and it's not what it was trying to deliver.    Sessions last about 15 minutes.   There is a rampant murderer in the city (for cult reasons), and you can visit every landmark freely, spending one day to explore each area. I was expecting a bit more FTL or WeirdWorlds influence, with a deep lore that one could discover by playing it over and over again, but this is purely a mechanical game. Unfortunately, its mechanics are not robust enough to carry it, in my opinion. Presentation   The game's artstyle is not beautiful, nor unique. You can probably get that from the screenshots. But it's functional, and to be honest, it didn't prove very relevant in my enjoyment of the game. A great artstyle would certainly make it more enjoyable, but I could distinguish everything of important here, so it's fine.    The Music, however, was pretty neat! As you would expect from a Noir game, it features a lot of Jazz, with a bit of chiptune influences at times, and also Classical music in a couple of places (expensive hotels and the hunting club, for example). But for the most part, it's jazz. And it fits the detective vibe perfectly.    It's not something I'd listen to on my own time (it's simple, and not a lot of variety), but I didn't feel like turning it off while playing the game!     Now that this is out of their way, I'll explain how the game works.   You have 14 days to explore the city and find out who the culprit is, and bring him to justice. You have various different areas of the city to explore. You can explore one each day.   In those areas there are objects and people. In a restaurant, for example, you can speak to people there, and also explore the seats and tables for clues. Each area functions similarly. This exploration phase plays like a 2D side-scroller.    People can be either of 2: normal people, and sellers. Normal people can give you suspects (or give a very generic and not very convincing argument against them being a suspect... just flavour text), while vendors will try to sell you Food, Lockpicks or Bullets.   Examinable objects can also give you Locks, Bullets, Money, or Clues.   You'll need Locks to open doors or steal from vaults, and Bullets to... well... kill people. More on that later. Clues are a bit more interesting (although not too much). For your deductive reasoning, you'll have to find suspects that fit certain criteria. After you learn about a person, you'll know all of their attributes. Clues will provide you with the killer's attributes.   Each person has a faction, an occupation, a gender, and a name. The faction includes Police, Mob, and Civillian. Occupation can go from Artist or Chef to Tailor or Driver. Once you think you've found who the killer is, you check him on your notebook, and his location will be shown on the map.   Every clue is about the killer. This is very important (and also a big issue). No matter where you find it, the clue is always about the murderer. Also, the clues are Binary. A gun holster, for example, tells you (s)he's either from the Mob, or the Police. An ornate fabric tell you (s)he's either a Tailor, or a Dancer. And so on. There can't be contradictory clues, so you'll end up collecting just enough to find which aspect is common between them. If no one fits those traits, you'll need to speak to more people to get more suspects.---   This is a very uninteresting way of making you a detective, isn't it? There's barely any brainwork from the player! It's just about running around the place, inspecting every random background object (because that's where you get clues), and then finding the right choices. It doesn't feel like you're playing a detective, and every game ends up playing too similarly.    Since every clue is about the killer, you don't really need to go to the crime scenes or follow leads to find anything about him(her). You can just explore any place that's convenient to you, and you'll easily succeed. This is probably the biggest issue I have with it. There's not a lot of thinking in this game, and it completely takes the \"detective\" part out of the game.---   On the City, there are different possible events. There are Civillian Gatherings, Police/Mob takeovers, Crime Scenes, and fishy places. About he latter, I have no ideia... You get that information from the people, but there is nothing different in those areas.   The first 3 are areas dominated by said faction. This is relevant when you killed someone from the Police/Mob and left witnesses, or stole from either, as factions can then be hostile towards you, and shoot on sight. On Hard mode, there's always an hostile faction from the start.   CrimeScenes are areas without people, where you can look for clues, without the risk of getting murdered.    Other than that, one important aspect is the Hunger Meter. Yes. This has a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hunger meter. I'm sorry, that's rude. But seriously... Why?!   The game has nothing to do with survival, except for the fact that you have to buy food not to die. Each time you examine something, or open doors, you'll lose 3 points. A piece of food can give you from 100 to 300, depending on the price. I guess this puts a stop to spamming Z constantly, but it doesn't feel necessary to have such a \"feature\".---   This is a good segway!   The game is far too easy. There aren't too many suspects, and it's easy to find his attributes from the clues. Normal mode is not challenging at all. Hard Mode, can be fairly challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Food could be one of them, but you learn to play with it. The main reason is the factions that's trying to kill you. You have very limited bullets (1-2, usually), so you can't just kill everyone, which is good. However, while finding clues is very easy, finding all the suspects can take more effort, especially, when there's a faction that will kill you immediately, and there may also be hitmen on you, that seem to spawn randomly. You can literally enter an area and just die, because he was right in front of you, and you couldn't escape.    This helps the game having challenge, but still doesn't feel like being the detective was the focus. The detective part is a very thin layer, surrounded by all these other systems trying to keep you from examining it closely.---   I think I've covered most of it. It's a purely mechanical game, of getting clues and suspects, and then arresting them. Killing them ends the game, but not with a victory. There are some special systems, like stealing from factions (that piss them off) or killing everyone in an area not to leave witnesses, but those play a very minor role in the overall game. This is because the game isn't hard at all! When you die, it's mostly out of your control.   The only narrative, is present in the murderers appartment, where there are random logs (6), with a passage of his Egypt-mythology related killing spree. Nothing substancial at all, though. There are no interesting plots throughout the city, no lore, no interesting random events, nothing of the sort. It was what I was mostly looking forward to, unfortunately...   Conclusion. It's not an awful game. It's actually pretty solid, for what it is. If you're looking for a very simple game (perhaps a good first project), then go ahead. I enjoyed the game, but I don't consider it great at all. Lots of wasted potential, but an interesting effort nonetheless. Only higher from here!",

        "text": "   Hero Siege is a game that stands somewhere between a roguelike (most notably, The Binding of Isaac) and a dungeon-crawler (like Zelda, or Diablo).It certainly takes many aspects of those games, but turns them into something of its own.    I've only finished the game twice on normal mode, with a melee and a ranged class. I did try 2 others classes, but didn't beat the game with those, just wanted to try them out.   It's a weird game to review, actually. I don't consider it a good game. At all. However, if you manage to overcome all of its faults, it becomes a very fun game where you feel like a God and everything explodes around you. It's not well designed, but it surely is a lot of fun, at times!   There's quite a bit to mention about the game, so I'll try to write a brief overview of the game's systems, and then give an extended opinion about certain design concepts. Graphically, it has a 16bit style, very similar to how JRPGs look, only on a bigger scale. I liked it. Take into account though, that there is A LOT of things on the screen all at once, between enemies, destructable terrain, or permanent objects like trees. These often obstruct your vision of traps and enemy bullets, which makes it a bit too hard to dodge, early in the game. As I said, late in the game, you're God, so you will not worry about such petty matters.   I didn't pay much attention to the Music. Not that it was bad, but I play these games while zoning out with my own music, or podcasts. From what I've heard, it wasn't bad, but didn't really add to the experience.   The SoundEffects were actually pretty satisfying. Perhaps not on their own, but controller vibration was very well used to make you feel like you're actually exploding everything around you. The combination of these 2 was very good!   However! There's a problem inherent to this: when you're very aware that you're doing damage, you're not aware that you're taking it... The game doesn't give you much feedback when you're close to dying, and early on, it can mean your death. And prepare to die a lot, as the game is very unbalanced. More on that later.   Now, I'll try to just explain what the game actually is, mechanically.   You go from map to map, fighting waves of enemies. At the end of each map (6 waves), there's a random Boss fight, with a random item reward. Every 3 (or 5) Bosses, there will be a fixed Boss, marking the end of an Act. There are 4 Acts in the main game, with an additional 5th on the DLC (which I don't own).    While it is very similar to TBoI, it's much longer, and less structured. On each map, here's what you aim for:   - ActiveItems - you have 1 slot. You press a button to use it. It can go from healing you, droping a bomb, a barrage of missiles, giving you a potion, etc.   - PassiveItems - these are far more important. They often give you very powerful attributes, or perhaps a passive ability (like a chance of doing a long range attack along with you basic attacks, etc), or defensive/offensive orbital companions. This is where the meat of your progression is, aside from upgrading your skills.   - Chests - there are 3 chests. Some are common, and require no key. They contain keys, potions, or coins inside. There are Golden chests, that require a normal key (with a generally higher pay rate), and also Crystal Chests, that require a crystal key (and generally reward you with an item).   - Crypts - these are mini-dungeons, without a boss. Sometimes, they'll appear on the map. You'll usually find lots of traps and/or a puzzle inside. If you overcome it, you'll get a free item.   - Dungeons - these are similar to crypts, but they have a bigger focus on combat. More enemies, and also a Boss fight. It will also reward your with an item.   - Shops - these will have one item, one potion, and 4 stat upgrades, for different prices. It's hard to make use of them early on, but they're useful when you get enough money.   - Potions - these function like pills in TBoI. Their effect is unknown to you, until you try it. After that, you can use its color to recognize its effect (which is different in every run). These can grant you upgrades and downgrades, but they're essential to your success, since there will be a lot of them. It's your biggest source of attribute upgrades, aside from items, despite carrying a risk.   - Destructable objects can include crates, pots, or just vegetation. All of these drop something of potential use.   While there seem to be many options, the game has a very hard difficulty wall. Once you pass it, however, you'll snowball out of control, and reach the end of the game so overpowered that you don't need to dodge anything and you won't lose more than 5% of your HP, even walking over every trap and enemy.    The other important aspect of this game is your character.   There are a bunch of different classes (maybe 9? didn't count), some melee, some ranged. You gain XP by killing enemies, and are able to spend 2 attribute points, and 1 skill point. The attributes are the same for all classes (Damage, Attack Speed, Damage Reduction, and Health). The skills vary from class to class, but there are a few common features.   Every character you create has permanent progression (leveling is permanent). However, as I said, items and potions are the most important part of progression, and those are contained in the run itself. Each character is also level up individually.   The combat is more old-school than I was expecting, which I'm not sure it fits into what it's going for in terms of structure. But more on that later.    Most of it is passive abilities. Each character has 4 active skills, but they have a cooldown associated with, and while useful, they don't make as much of an impact as the passive ones. A lot of your skill tree is having a %chance of doing *action* when you attack. I actually liked that aspect of the game, but it also makes gameplay closer between classes.   With all of this, I can see people milking this game for hundreds of hours, between classes and different difficulties. However, it doesn't seem to be as replayable as, say, TBoI, due to its length. Each run may take 3 hours, and is long enough for you to get most of the items.    The game has many flaws (which I failed to mention), but it can be a fun game, if you overcome its difficulty. It's not expensive, so sure, give it a try!---I keep screwing it up. I need to summarize these reviews more to have space to actual discuss design decision. Anyway, here's what I think is wrong with the game.   The most important aspect here, is balance, which this game lacks a lot! There are inumerous different enemies, and these have modifiers as well, so there's quite a bit to consider when you're early in the game. Some of them are fine, while others explode on death, or do damage around them when they're hit... This isn't good at all with melee characters, for example. Early on, you'll die over and over and over again, because of this aspect. Another, is traps that are often obstructed by terrain, or even enemy projectiles. This, coupled with the lack of feedback, makes your life really freakin' hard.   It reminded my of NES Castlevanias, almost. Everything needed to be methodical. Which I love! However, those games were much shorter. In a roguelike of this length, I don't think it works as well.   Well, more in the comments. Sorry about this! I'll try to revise my writing in future reviews.

        "text": "Lilly Looking Through is a point n' click game, with a beautiful artstyle, and simple enough mechanics to dodge most of the genre's common problems.   You play as Lilly, trying to save your brother, Row. The game ends in a sort of cliffhanger (after 2 hours only), so the plot was very minimal here, and it's a bit of a hard sell for the 10$ they're asking. However, I think the game is competent enough at what it does, even if it doesn't do a lot.   Without the shadow of a doubt, the game's highlight is its Presentation. Everything has been hand-drawn and animated, and the result is gorgeous, in my opinion. It's the game that warrants a relaxing playthrough, taking the time to appreciate the backgrounds instead of just solving the puzzles.   Each area is distinct from the others, and has 2 planes (one in the past, one in the present). The present is usually a ruined version of the past's splendour, but both are pretty in their own way.   If the game was more fluid (I'm not even sure it reached 30fps), it could have been of the quality of a simple tv animation. It's pretty good.   The music was also very good, although not as striking, I think would be a good way to describe it. It's very soothing, ambience music. A good aspect, though, is how there are 2 tracks: 1 for each plane. The present usually had a more \"beaten\" sound, with an acoustic guitar, while the past was more majestic and epic, with the use of strings. Of course, this is a gross simplification, but it's enough to give you an idea.   I went well with the game.   The sound effects, on the other hand, were a bit too aggressive, I feel. Not always, but sometimes.   Here are my problems regarding the artstyle and animation:   The backgrounds are a bit too blurry (although the problem seemed to disappear after a while -- maybe I got used to it), and the characters had a different style to it, feeling a bit detached. The characters were very clean colored (barely had shadows, for example), while the backgrounds were significantly more complex. It's not horrible, but it didn't feel quite right at the start of the game.    Other than that, the problem is that the animations were a bit too slow, and unskippable. While it is pretty to look at, some puzzles require experimentation, and it takes a bit too long with these stretched animations. The game is only 2 hours long, so I can't say it's a huge problem, but it would certainly be, with more complex puzzles.    Now, let's talk about mechanics.   As I said, the game is very simple. For instance, there is no inventory, or object carrying. If you every need to use an object, you simply click on it (from the ground), and then click on what you're supposed to. There's no Examine/Give/Use function or anything like that. It's very straightforward, and makes the puzzles self contained.   If you're a fan of the point n' click genre, you may not like this. If you're not, then this is probably good!   The game's main mechanic, is a pair of Goggles. By using them, you see the past plane. It's not a well explored mechanic, but it's used, and it's nicely so. For example, you plant an acorn in the past, and in the future there's a tree. There are other uses, but I think this exemplifies it well enough.   But yes, most of the game revolves around this. You change planes to surpass most of the obstacles. There is also a lot of color puzzles in the last few puzzles. The puzzles are generally fairly easy, so there's no need for the game to teach concepts to the player.   Again, it is a very simple game. You mostly play it for the imagery, I would imagine. And it's relaxing, if you're into that.There's no plot, no complex puzzles (although they're not achieved at first try, for the most part)... It seems a bit lacking, overall. It's a beautiful game, but it's very limited at what it does.   So, be aware of what you're buying. In my opinion, it's a well put experience, for what it is. Perhaps a bit too expensive, but I try to keep that out of the equation.   I would recommend it if you're interested after reading this, you shouldn't be disappointed, unless you're expecting a decently sized game. It seems more of a prototype than a full game, but for that, it's not bad.--------------   There isn't much to take from this, but I'll try to think a bit more about it.This is not actually part of the review itself, more of an outside the box analysis, trying to figure out what more there could be (or something that a game simply missed on its mark.   As I said, there's barely any mechanics to actually learn, or plot to follow. This means that it's almost looking at paintings. Well, almost...   There seems to be a huge blank spot waiting to be filled, here. The fact that it's so simple, leaves a lot of space for other content to be presented. When you can simply lay back and appreciate the atmosphere, it has the power to be a bit more than just atmosphere. Carry some ideals, maybe represent an era, something along those lines.   The point here is that games can sometimes try to build an heavy world and characters that can get overlooked when the player has to learn complex mechanics, or is simply distracted by fast paced combat. It's up to these simpler games to present that rich world, even if just in a very artistic manner, rather than preaching something.   Lilly Looking Through doesn't take any advantage of that, but I believe it has the right pacing to do. Thinking outside the gaming industry, movies like Spirited Away, Angel's Egg, Fantastic Planet, The Secret of Kells, Kino's Journey etc. carry a bit of that, in my opinion. It's not about teaching the player about something in particular, but perhaps shed light on things from a different perspective, and provide food for thought in a more artistic way.    This is me rambling, but I think it's a good exercise, if nothing else. Something useful may occur to me, one of these days, haha!",

        "text": "The Sun at Night is a metroidvania game set in a strangely unique setting. You're Laika, the first dog sent into orbit. However, instead of miserably burning along with the ship, you're now a robot dog, joining the Rebel force against the Soviets, who seem to dominate the Earth (and beyond).     I'll give you some time to take that in. Even the game's characters find it strange that you're a talking dog in silver armor. With a gun mounted on your back. Yes.   The concept probably got your interest already, I assume. Execution isn't nearly as great, and I'll try to explain the best I can.   I usually try to describe the games I review on the whole, but that takes up way too much space, and makes for a not so informative review. So I'll just try to sum up the general aspects that make the game succeed or fail as a game, and then make a few longer paragraphs of particular aspects. Presentation-wise, it's a mixed bag. The bosses were usually pretty nicely designed, but there are several problems with the backgrounds. Some are simply ugly (and low-res), with lots of empty space (that's literally black, at times), but others make a big mistake by making the background and foreground exactly the same color. The first screen of the game has this problem. It makes it really hard to distinguish platforms from nothing, especially in a 2D game (not 2.5D).   Tied to that, is the fact that interactable and non-interactable objects in the game have no distinction. This means that instead of looking for an actual object when walking around, you'll have to look for a text pop-up. It makes exploration far less interesting.   Overall, is feels very un-polished and reminded me of Valley Without Wind. It's likely a hit or miss. Sound Design was mixed as well. The sound effects were generic, and not very pleasant, I would say. The music was pretty good, though! If not misplaced, at times. It was very game-y, like taking old MegaMan style music and giving a slightly more modern sound. It's not as catchy, though. But it's not bad at all!   Combining these two, a problem I've had, was the fact that there was very little audio-visual response when you took damage or were close to dying. This led to many deaths in the start of the game, because I was simply not aware of how close I was to death.   As a segue, the game felt very weightless. The controls were a bit floaty, the weapons didn't really pack a punch, etc. etc. It didn't feel very good to actually play, which is unfortunate, as it is one of the most important aspects.   The game itself is mission based. There are 4 missions, and they're pretty huge. You have to follow a main objective, but you'll also find side-objectives. There's a LOT of backtracking in these maps, and you're likly to get lost. Why? Well, while the game is 2D, the maps connect in a 3D planes, with inumerous intersections between the smaller rooms. The map function is useful, sure, but it takes a while getting used to.    The problem I have with this, is the fact that the maps are needlessly big. Most of the rooms are there to simply fill the map. There's a lot of empty space, meaningless rooms with a few enemies. This makes the game a lot more boring than it could have been, if the rooms were actually interesting. There's also no fast travel function, which means that you'll have to navigate the complicated maps a lot. To aggravate the problem, the map marks some rooms with a door, but doesn't tell you it's locked. So you might want to just see what's left, walk for 15 minutes, and then walk back, disappointed, because it was simply a locked door (it also happened that some rooms were locked from one side only -- I tried going through one door that was open, and then had to walk for 20 minutes because I couldn't go back the way I came).   In these maps, you'll fight enemies, and explore for Nano Batteries (which you use to buy upgrades), new Weapons, and Ammo. There are also lots of terminals and notes spread across, for you to learn about the story (these prove a problem, however, which I'll talk about later).   You have 3 Upgrade Sections: Utility, Offense and Defense. You can upgrade your speed, get Double/Wall Jumps,  get a better Shield, upgrade each Weapon, etc. I liked the upgrade system, actually. It gave me a good sense of progression, and significantly altered some of the gameplay.   There's also a sort of crafting system for ammo and health/shield packs. You have Raw Nano, which you can use to fabricate these. You can also reduce them, if you have more than you need, and use it to get something more scarce. There's an upgrade that makes it more efficient, which is very useful. The problem with this, is that it takes like 3 clicks to reduce or fabricate something. It would take 20 times that number to fully fabricate ammo, for example. It takes a loong time to do this. Especially when you're reducing and fabricating repeatedly (since you get major returns, with the upgrade) to give yourself \"infinite\" resources. This could be solved with a simple counter. You could set it to fabricate 20 at once, and there, problem solved. But as it is, it's a very inefficient system overall. But it's good that it's there, I guess.   Last aspect about the mechanics, is the Save System. There are checkpoints spread out through the map (unevenly so). If you die, you'll have to replay everything from the last time you saved at the checkpoint. This could be fine, but it's not, since they're so far apart. Besides, it's easy to die because you were distracted. So, it leads to even more backtracking. It could be easily solved by saving at when entering a new room, or just manual saves. Or even get you all the way back to the checkpoint, but keeping your progress and collectables.---   That's all. Now, what the game did interestingly, it how it wanted to construct its universe, with ideals and views on communism and war in general. This could have been stellar, but...  When you start the game, you're thrown into the rebel camp. The characters there have real personality, despite exchanging very few words with you. But as I said, some seemed genuinely good, and it would have been great to have a component focused heavily on them. But you're introduced to all these characters, and they're never developed. They're only in that first section, and then abandoned.   That's the first problem.   The second, is how it tries to pass its ideology to the player. It's all done through notes and terminals spread across the levels. However, it usually throws terms at you, without giving them proper context. If you're not familiar with communism and the cold war, then you're very likely not to understand 90% of it.    This is important. Context. You can't explain an ideal without its context or reasons. It will simply fall on deaf ears, understandably so.   Tied to this, is a huge overload of incoherent information. The notes spread across are often disconnected from each other, so you'll just be getting bits and pieces of an overall message, all fragmented. And there's A LOT of them in the game. So, after a while, since the player isn't getting the whole idea, he will simply start filtering through all of those, and closing his mind. I ended up reading most of them in diagonal, as the game went on, because of the sheer amount of text that didn't provide as much use as it should.    This could be helped by compressing the notes a bit more. There were more paragraphs of text it each than was necessary. If there were simply short, concise phrases, the game would have benefited more.-   Overall, I think it was an overambitious project. You could see all the great ideas, but they seemed poorly executed and too rushed. Maybe they can solve all these problems in a future game. Because the ideas are there, definitely!",

        "text": "   Major Mayhem is an arcade rail-shooter, with which I have very little experience (the only one I can sort of put in a similar bag is Rescue Shot on the PSX, actually).   Despite coming from mobile, it looked enjoyable, and so I decided to give it a go.    I'll say this right away: if a rail-shooter is exactly what you're looking to play, then it's probably safe to get this. If you're looking for interesting games or examples of great game design, look elsewhere. This is not to say that the game is bad, but it's very generic and \"by the book\". There isn't much in here to make it stand out (aside from being a rail-shooter, a rare genre today, it seems).   Here are my indepth thoughts, starting with  Presentation   As I said, it came right from mobile, and it's very noticeable. Big buttons on the menus, lack of options, missions, etc. etc. It was a free game with microtransactions, but, on Steam, you pay 5$, and then don't have them in the game. I'm not sure how much of a grind it was with MT, but progression is still pretty slow. But you can certainly get every useful item without the game feeling stale. Visually, it's simple, but it looks good, in my opinion. Doesn't do much to stand out either, but it's clean and colourful, with 3 different areas (each with 2 different enemy types -- the same 2, but reskinned). It does the job.   On the game's favor, it does a good job of telling you when you hit someone, for the most part, or when enemies shoot you. It only pales when you're using explosive, or high rate of fire weapons, since your bullet effects can obscure the screen a bit too much.   On the Audio side, it actually surprised me. The music is very bland, and gets repetitive, so I turned it off very early and just put something I wanted to listen to. The weapon sound effects, though, were great! Most of the weapons had a distinctive sound, and it really packed a punch when you shot the enemies' heads, or did some power shots.    So yeah, while it suffers on the music, the sound effects were very good, and a great indicator of your damage!   Now, how's the game Structured? Well, as I said, there are 3 areas. Each one has 15 levels, including a Boss Fight on the 15th. Unfortunately, the level design is almost inexistent. Most of the levels play out very similarly (well, just point and shoot). The fact that there are only 2 (common) enemies doesn't help at all... but more on that later.   There are campaign, arcade, timebomb, and survival modes.    -In Campaign, you just play the levels one by one, and are scored at the end (up to 3 medals). Probably the mode you should play first.   -In Arcade, you play the missions randomly and just play until you want to stop. If you lose all the 3 lives, you can just use/buy a continue and you'll keep going with the same score.   -In Survival, you have to try to play an area in one sitting, without dying. There are no continues. But other than that, just beat 15 levels at once.   -Finally, in TimeBomb, you're given 1 minute to just try to maximize your score (like a mini-level in a semi-random area).   The game has a decent number of weapons (and half of them play out very differently -- while the other half are mostly side-grades of previous ones). And each has their own use in different situations (especially when you're going for highscores). While they're distinct, they're mostly very generic as well, when there was a chance to make crazy weapons to make the game more fun. You get Snipers, Rifles, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers, etc. etc.   You get these weapons by Ranking up. You do this by completing Missions. These are like mini-achievements that you're given. There are 150 in total, but you only have 3 active at a time -- and you do the ones you're given, no freedom there. There is a big problem with this. While these missions can improve variety and make the player go for different weapons and strategies, there's a major flaw: they're desynchronized with the actual ranks and weapon progression. I don't know how they screwed it up, but it just doesn't follow it... It would have been easy to get a mission for a specific weapon when you ranked up enough to get it. But nah, these missions are all over the place, often making you play a style that you've played before.   This is a big reason for the game's slow progression. Having 5 mission at a time would have been a good alterantive, perhaps. Or just give the player a chance to change them around (or queue them).    What else is there to talk about?   So far, the game seems very limited from what I said. And for the most part, it is. The the various modes, achievements and missions may prolong its lifespan, if this is what you're looking for. Since I wanted to try out every weapon, I kept playing, trying out the different modes, getting higher scores, and went as far as playing the whole game without dying (with 3 survival missions in a row).    It's very monotonous if you're not into rail shooter. However, for what it is, I don't think it's all that bad.   A game that's just about pointing and shooting... that doesn't sound very good. Well, there's a bit more depth to it, when you're going for highscores.   You have Combo and Damage meters.   The enemies shoot lots of fake bullets at you (to increase the adrenaline, I guess), but their real shots are very clear. You can shoot these bullets (if you're precise and fast enough), and you'll up your combo meter with these. Killing enemies before shooting will also increase your combo. Not getting hit as well.   The damage combo, you get from killing enemies, and shooting them while they're dead and on the ground as well. So you'll be constantly shooting something for the highscores, not just trying to survive (which is a bit too easy).   And to top it, the game is just very smooth. It feels pretty good to play, despite its simplicity in concept and execution. The enemies are all physics driven, after dying, so you can also screw around with that. Overall, it's a pretty well put together game. Good controls are surprising for a mobile port, but they certainly give the game a much better chance.   Other than that, there's typical mobile stuff. 5 power-ups (invincibility, super bullets, and air strike and bullet time), which you sometimes get with drops, or can buy with in-game currency. And lots of skins. Head-wear and Body-wear. These are simply cosmetical, and you also get with in-game currency. It keeps the character from looking the same for the whole game, nothing wrong with it.    I think I'll finish the review here.   It's very, VERY light on game design. The only noteworthy aspect would the high-score system, I'd say. Very limited enemy and level variety, uninteresting weapons, ... It doesn't sound very good.   But it simply plays very well! The weapons, while generic, feel different, there are several different approaches to your playstyle, and rail-shooters aren't exactly something we're drowning in.   So yes. IF you're looking for something like this, you'll probably be entertained with Major Mayhem for a while. If not, go find some other game, since this one isn't special in any way. Just not bad.",

        "text": "   Antichamber is a weird game to review, as it stands on a league of its own. It's not trying to be a good game. On the contrary, it's actually throwing most conventions out the window, and challenging the player to see it through.    Let's say it's a first person puzzle game. If you need a comparison, Portal would be a decent choice. However, where Portal clearly gives you the mechanics and expects you to use them to solve the puzzles, Antichamber makes you dig a lot to find those mechanics and how it all fits and interacts. The game is purposely trying to bend the players' minds at every turn, and it certainly succeeds in doing exactly that!   I'm not going to do the usual review on this game. It simply wouldn't work, and would achieve nothing. So I'm going to try to convey the game's fundamental aspects, and you'll then judge for yourself if you're interested enough.   The game also has some Metroid-vania elements regarding its map. However, while those games obey \"real-world\" rules, Antichamber laughs at them. The whole game is a non-Euclidian maze (meaning it doesn't obey 3D geometry rules -- when you turn back, the rooms may have changed; maybe you can go down enough that you're back where you're started; you get the idea). However, you are given a very useful map, which functions almost as a progress meter. With its use, you'll know *some* of the connected areas, but above all else, you'll know when there are still ways to uncover in a given room.   Antichamber is essentially about sheer willpower and deconstruction. You're not given anything. Instead, you need to find it yourself, and then experiment with your new tools to solve more of the puzzles. The game also has a few signs with messages, giving you feedback for your actions (and the meaning of life, if you're so inclined). It works almost as post-tutorialization. The game is about learning for yourself. About having to learn to progress. Since the knowledge you had previously (as conventions) doesn't work, you'll have to start from the very beginning. To solidify your discoveries, the game usually gives you a short phrase (and picture) to relate it to life itself. And it helps giving context to what you're doing, setting it all in stone.    Eventually, you'll be able to make the game's logic almost conventional, weirdly enough. You adapt to the weird world you've been thrown in, and it feels great to realize how far you've come.  There are lots of branching paths, each leading to a new puzzle. However, you have a Hub Area in which you can jump into every puzzle directly (after you've found it). It would be impossible to complete the game without it, since traversing the map is everything but convenient. This is also something that goes well with the fact that you'll be stuck a lot.   Either you haven't learned a certain mechanic well enough, or you're lacking a certain tool for a puzzle. But you'll be forced to turn back. And the game helps you with that a lot. So you'll be constantly trying out new puzzles, and shying away from others. It's fine. The game was made with that very intent, and it uses that to its advantage, avoiding a lot of frustration.   Another aspect is that there are mostly no wrong actions. Everything is a choice, and the game responds to everything you do -- it may just not be the answer you were looking for.   I've seen the question on the forums \"What's the point\"? Well... there is not point, other than discovery, and basically deconstructing the world until you master its own way of thinking. You don't have anyone to save or kill. No reward waiting for you either. But curiosity will certaily keep you moving forward -- well, maybe not technically forward... up and to the right, maybe. Maybe backwards, who knows? -- and it's incredibly rewarding to solve some puzzles that were particularly difficult to you.    It is a very, very unique game. And it's hard to explain what it is or why anyone should play it. But I'll say this: it's the game I'd recommend to most people, even if they're not into games. And that's because it's an unique experience, not necessarily tied to traditional games. The same may happen with movies or even music. People may not like movies all that much, but there are some that are worth watching anyway, for one reason or another.   Again, it's on a league of its own. It also shares some similarities with Fez, in that regard. However, Fez requires you to take knowledge from outside of the game, while Antichamber requires you to throw all knowledge away.    There are also some Dev Rooms that will give you some information about the development of the game. It's nice that they're there.   If you want to be challenged, dazed and confused... Definitely get this game. And play it through without a guide, otherwise its charm is all lost. Persistence is important, but it's one of the most rewarding games I've played in a long, long time. And it works nicely as food for thought as well.    I have never played anything even remotely close to Antichamber (not saying it's the best game I've ever played, simply that it's very different from everything else I came across), and it's a well executed game. It's interesting not only in concept, but in practice as well. Give it a go!",

        "text": "Steamworld Dig is a cross between a Metroid-vania and a Dungeon Crawler. Its focus, however, is the mining experience, rather than the combat. And it's works surprisingly well! You use your collected resources to upgrade your equipment, which makes traversing the map easier, as well as being able to mine deeper and deeper.  I'll say that I have not played the 3DS version, but I wouldn't have noticed that this was a mobile port. Everything is very fluid and it just works perfectly overall, unlike many mobile ports we see on Steam. Presentation   It's a very good and clean looking game, in my opinion. Everything looks polished, is what I'd say. It gives off a good Steampunk vibe, and the character designs have a unique cartoon style as well.   It has solid lighting effects as well, that look nice and also provide a good mechanic for you to know when it's needed to go back to the surface.   There isn't much else to say, really. It looks great! And it's functional, as I've never had a problem with the backgrounds, or anything at all...   The music was a pleasant surprise too! The soundtrack is only 15 minutes long, but its purpose was achieved: atmosphere, rather than getting a melody stuck in your head. And I have absolutely no problem with that.   It uses a Blues-like vibe, with a more metallic texture, if you will, with a few Western whistles... you get the drill (eh). I actually reminded me of Torchlight or Diablo's music! Especially Tristram Village, only less dark. I really enjoyed the music.   One complaint I have is with the voices... Speaking gibberish isn't a problem for me, but it got really annoying at times, with some vendors. When you're speaking to the shopkeepers, they describe the item you're looking at every time... Since they're not really saying anything very useful, it seems like a cacophony of sounds... But that only happens when you're upgrading in the town, so it's not too bad.   So, onto the game's Structure, then.   You do virtually the same thing 3 times. And while I don't quite understand how it does it, it works! The game has 3 main sections. Each section has a certain visual theme (and some new enemies), and features 3 optional and 3 mandatory \"dungeons\" (perhaps it's the wrong word, as they're mostly just a room).    The optional dungeons were quite interesting, actually: you simply go there to get more minerals/orbs (more on that later), but they function as puzzle rooms. They have certain blocks and enemies set in a specific way. And to overcome them, you will often have to think of a method that you hadn't previously thought of. The best thing is that these methods will help you on the outer mines, so it ends up being almost a tutorial, but one that is well done and almost seemless!   The mandatory dungeons were generally larger, but they always provide you with a new upgrade. These can be an actual ability (like a Drill, a Double Jump, etc.), or just a useful passive (No fall damage, minerals show up on the map, etc.). Whenever you got an active ability, you then had to use it to leave the dungeon (or go over a specific obstacle) so, again, good teaching.   Each area gets harder as you go through, but they're very similar, all things considered. They usually have the previous enemies reskinned, and then one or two other types added. Combat is NOT the focus of this game, but it proves a good break of pace to attack/avoid enemies. Otherwise, it would simply be mindless digging, and that would be too monotonous. Some enemies are trickier than others, but there are usually ways to defeat them more easily.   Your main object is simply to go in and collect minerals, and then go back to the surface and sell them. With the gold you make, you can upgrade your various abilities, or buy utility items (such as Teleporters, Lanterns, Ladders, Dynamite,  etc.). Of the utility items, I've only used Dynamite and Teleporters. But there are options, if you want them!   The whole game is basically just getting in and out of the mines. Thrice!   I'm not sure why it works (since the upgrades are usually not that radical), but I've had fun during the whole game, so they've done something right! The game's fluidity in going through the mines probably helps and lot. It's actually fun to jump around the various tunnels, clearing minerals on the way. And the rest is in the hands of OCD and Compulsive Buying Disorder. One simply must mine every shiny things, and then clear out the shops... Maybe this sounds really bad (haha!) but it was fun. And the atmosphere also adds to the enjoyment of the actions.    The way the mining actually works is that you your character has: Health, Water (mana), and Light.    Light depletes as you stay underground for a certain time. It's a gradual loss, giving you time to decide when to go back. The only downside to staying down there is that you won't be able to see the minerals (and barely anything else as well), but there's no actual danger of dying. To help with this, you can buy \"Lamps\". However, this are just static, and I don't really see the point. They're not expensive, but don't iluminate much either. The only reason why they COULD be useful, is if they could mark a spot on your map.   This is a metroid-vania afterall, so the player expects some backtracking (specially for hard to reach minerals). So if he saw something unreachable, he could mark the stop with a Lamp, and then go there later on, without forgetting everything about it. But those are my 2 cents on it. It's not really a problem here, just a minor suggestion.   Water works when you need to use special abilities, or you Drill. Most of the blocks can be destroyed with your Pickaxe. Rock, however, requires a Drill. This drill is more powerful than the pickaxe, but it requires water to work. If you run out of water, you'll have to find a pool underground to restore it.   That basically it. As you get deeper and deeper, the blocks will become slower and slower to mine, which is a side that you'll have to upgrade your mining material.   So yeah, you go down and mine. Then you go up a sell it to upgrade and mine even deeper. There's no complex crafting system (of say, Terraria), it's just mining and upgrading to mine deeper and more expensive. It's a weird concept to me, but I've enjoyed it more than I expected!   You can upgrade everything from your Health to your Water capacity, Water usage, Light duration, mining power, etc. etc. etc. You can just buy the upgrades as you see fit, conforming to your needs. The game sort of balances itself out, this way.   When you die, you simply go back to the village. All of your minerals are dropped to the floor (and you need to get back there to pick them up -- like DemonSouls), and you also lose half of your gold.   I don't think there's much else to say about it. The story wasn't particularly striking to me. There's a Boss fight in the end (not too hard), and there are also some achievements for completionists. I'll commend these for having some pretty tough tasks that would actually be an achievement (like completing the whole game without dying). Others are just there to incentivise you to explore.   These last 3 weeks for me have been mostly marked by not very good games. They were interesting, sure, but execution was lacking. As such, Steamworld Dig came as a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting much out of a game that's based around mining (and looking back, it doesn't do anything really stunning, it's a very simple and by the book game), but I enjoyed the whole time I played it.   I've finished it in about 6/7 hours, with every secret found, and every mineral mined. After this, all there is left to replayability is trying out to finish the game as efficiently as possible. That's not for me, but if you're into that stuff, you can take more out of it.   Good one!",

        "text": "   Bad Hotel is a game that challenges the Tower Defense formula in a quite creative way. Instead of placing towers around a map, you have to build blocks around your Hotel, protecting it.   Each block has a different function, and you must combine them to fend off each wave.   While I really like the idea (and would like to play something like this), the execution is very poor... to the point that I'm not even going to complete it. And that's fairly rare for me.   The main problem with it is that the difficulty curve is incredibly steep, and relies a lot on trial and error. But first things first.Presentation   As you can see from the screenshots, the game looks very simple. But it has an elegant design that fits the style. Each chapter also has a different distinct look to it, so it keeps things fresh.It's colorful and minimalistic, but there's much else I can say that you can't see for yourself.    It works, but it won't blow you away.   The music and sound effects, on the other hand, were carefuly designed, and I really like what it's trying to do.    Each block emits a sound to a beat. While you may get a cacophony when you have a lot of rooms, it always sets a nice break of flow whenever they're destroyed, as you notice it right away, just from the sound.   Sure, it's a little gimmicky, and, in this case, not very musical at all, but I like when games try to make the player influence the music. Each chapter also has a distinct sound to it, which is a plus.   So, what exactly is wrong with this game's design?   Well, first, the levels are not very interesting to actually play.   Basically, you have a room that serves are mere protection and moneymaker, and then you have Guns, Cannons, Freezing bullets, Healing rooms, and Bombs (as far as I got, anyway). Each category may or may not have more than one room available on a given level, but differences are simply on their cost/power.   You play the game by involving your Hotel in these rooms, to fight each wave. Different enemies may require different strategies to defeat them, which is cool. The problem is that the level's pacing is a bit too fast. Enemies come fast and furious, and you usually fail the level very fast, since you need a solid start to be able to keep up with the waves.    You are given absolutely NO information about your rooms (outside of actually trying them in the levels), and no information about the waves either. So you're just blindly going into each level... You need to resort to simple trial and error to beat them. And you know... it's no that fun to do that. You'll just have to keep buying rooms until something works, and you then follow it up until you beat the level.     Perhaps more information beforehand would have helped it a lot. You're not the one who chooses the rooms for each level, either. You have to make due with what you're given. But that's fine, it keeps you changing your strategy.   Then, the biggest problem (for me) is that the levels get incredibly difficult. It seems like there are very limited ways of beating each level, and the enemies easily overwhelm you, making you restart levels countless times until you find the right combination... and it's not very rewarding either.   The levels are pretty short, though, which keeps the frustrating lower than it would otherwise be. But overall, I was simply not having fun, and the rest of the game didn't seem to have much else to show.   To the game's credit, though, I'll say that they tried to keep the levels varied, making the player constantly change mindsets to beat different levels. For example, in some levels, you have no weapons. Which means that you'll just build freezing weapons and money blocks to hold enemies off for the time. On others you have to use more bombs, etc.    They actually feel pretty different, and it's great that they try to keep things fresh. Unfortunately, it is not enough.   The Boss fights weren't bad either, although they just seemed to be beaten by bruteforce alone, rather than with tactics...    Another very important issue, is that the game is broken. Pressing Esc should open the pause menu for you to restart the level, go back to the menu, etc. Well, sometimes, it does. Other times, it crashes the game. Sometimes, it will send you to some point in the previous level (halfway through it) and back to the present level at a second press. It usually crashes after that too.    Sounds confusing? Yeah, imagine MY reaction... I have no idea why that happens. But it happens a lot.   It also has a cruel pleasure out of deleting your saved games (I don't know why). However, you can just play any level whenever you want, so it's not THAT bad. Still annoying, but hey...   So yeah. I can't recommend this game at all. It has some interesting ideas, but it's just falls short of what it wanted to be. If the difficulty was more gradual, and the game didn't often crash when you want to restart a level (which you need to do a lot!), I may have enjoyed it far more, and finished it.    As it stands, though, it's just a not very well implemented idea, and one that I have no intention of experiencing to the end...",

        "text": "   Motte Island is a low-fi horror game, with a top-down perspective. Your objective is to go into Motte Island to save your sister from the townsfolk, and uncover whatever secrets they were hiding.   You'll probably be able to finish the game in 3 or 4 hours, and while there are different endings, it does not warrant a replay, since the endings are merely decided by the final section of the game. There are collectible photos spread around, though, each providing a cutscene for you to learn more about the island. Presentation   As I said, this is a very low fidelity game, especially regarding its artstyle. The goodside is that low-fi actually works great with horror games! While everything is low-res, dark and full of blurry fog, it sets a nice atmosphere, and lets your mind piece in what's missing.   However, it's not a pretty game at all, on the contrary, it's quite ugly. Lone Survivor or even Home, were low-fi, but still weren't as ugly and Motte Island is. But overall, I think it sets the tone, and achieves its purpose!   Animation is very limited as well, which is more noticeable in the cutscenes, but it's not a big deal in the whole scheme of things.   The sound design in general was pretty good, actually! Everything worked towards the same atmosphere, and there was also a more oppressive track whenever you were engaged in battle. Unfortunately, the track was always the same, which got tiresome at times.   There were also a couple of jump-scares thrown in, but were quite repetitive, losing its effect.    The enemies didn't sound very scary, but all of the other ambience sounds were good.   It's not perfect, but taking its scope into account, I think it comes out as a positive, and helps the game!   So far so good! Now comes my reasoning for not recommending this game.   I see what it's trying to do, but similarly to Eleusis, the game itself is not interesting at all. It has a great atmosphere, but lacks purpose and place to use that atmosphere in.    Most of the time, you'll be traveling around the island (which is essentially just a small village), collecting random items. And, very much like Eleusis, they force you to go back and forth several times while you could easily collect several items at once. (These also blend in with the ground, at times, making them very hard to see... this, of course, increases frustration when you're just constantly walking around, not sure what you're looking for)  While you have (supposedly) 3 guns in the game, I only found one, and even that was necessary to the story and not through exploration. What I did find, was a bunch of ammo that I didn't get to use... And some enemies also carried guns that you couldn't pick up, for some unknown reason. Missed chance.  This means that I've only used melee weapons for the whole game. Think of it as Hotline Miami. But instead of the very fast in-and-out, twitch gameplay, each enemy requires several hits to die (you have light/heavy attacks, but the heavy are mostly for stealth), so you'll just hit them and backing off repeatedly. A more reliable way of doing it, is using stealth. You can approach enemies from behind, and kill them in 1 hit.   ... or you can just run away from them. Why would you do it? Because they respawn. Yes, every time you enter/exit an area, the enemies respawn. This really does defeat the tension. There's a lot of pointless fighting, and not much fear. While I did kill them at first, I eventually just started running away since fighting was pointless and laborious. While there is a decent number of weapons, they all play similarly, so it's not exactly a positive.   So yeah. The atmosphere is completely wasted on shores and backtracking, as well as too much \"safe\" combat.   Aside from this main gameplay, there also 2 other sections: a side-scroller, and a cover-based fps.   In the first, you \"drive\" a car, while obstacles come down from the top of the screen. This was the most disorienting experience I've had with gaming in a loooong time. Everything happened too fast, with the obstacles sending you flying to the sides... Jesus... I'm not even sure it was possible to fail. I was hitting almost everything (it was unpleasant) but eventually go through with it.   Then, there's the fps sections. One functions as a mini horde mode, and the other as a Boss fight. You can shoot, and you can be in cover, reloading. It wasn't very good either. The hit detections, specially, was not very tight. And there were always enemies spawning in the limits of the screen. In the last boss fight it was especially bad...   These two sections are extremely forced and have no place in the game, to be honest. I understand \"variety\", but come one!...   One last aspect I want to mention, is the story/writing. It's... bad. And I'm not talking about the number of grammatical errors (quite a lot), but the actual story and characters. The plot is completely senseless. For example, the villagers act like a bunch of maniacs, but suddenly, they're not the bad guys because everything goes to s***. It makes no sense how they're portrayed. It's a very artificial way of making you dislike them. And that would be fine, if they didn't change their minds halfway through. By then, how could I side with the villagers?    My actions from that point onwards made no sense, which threw the story out the window. The dialogue is also pretty cheesy, but hey...   I'm sounding really negative here. To be completely honest, I did enjoy the game during the first 2 hours. It was cool, the atmosphere immersed me more than I was expecting, and everything was well, while I was exploring the village. Unfortunately, it then started just going in circles, and then introduced very rushed mechanics, ruining the overall experience.   I can see what it was trying to do, and it's unfortunate that it simply didn't get there quite yet. But it has a couple of good aspects about it, so I'll look forward to their next game. Hopefuly, they'll learn from mistakes and make much more competent experiences!",

        "text": "Vlad the Impaler is a text-based game with some RPG elements, set in 15th century Istanbul (or Constantinople/Byzantium).You're sent to the city by none other than Vlad III (the Impaler), to investigate and annihilate the darkness involving it.   Do NOT expect an historically accurate narrative. It deals a lot with religious and supernatural themes (not in a very serious manner, but more to set the tone), and it represents Vlad more as the Dracula we're familiar with than the historical character.Some of the events may resemble actual history/culture, but use it as a stepping stone to investigate yourself and nothing else.   I'm mentioning this because of some Community Hub discussions that arose from this confusion. These discussions are great, with people researching for something and exchanging ideas, but please, don't take it completely out of context!   A good comparation for this game would be, I believe, The Yawhg. It's not quite the same, but close enough to be mentioned.Even less, is FTL or Weird Worlds (some aspects). All of these are designed to be highly replayable, with several branching paths (mini-archs) and some overall goal and story that you learn about as you play more and more. The 2 latter games have far deeper mechanics, while this is almost exclusively text-based (each encounter has a binary choice), with different stats that will define your fate against the final \"Boss\".   I have enjoyed the game during my 2 first playthroughs, and I was initially going to give it a recommendation... However, the more I played, the more problems I've found with it, and how flawed the game design actually is. In these 4 hours I've done 5 or 6 runs through the game.   Take into account that the first was significantly lengthier, since I was reading every piece of text carefuly. The more I played, the more repetition there was, and shorter the runs got. It's not a long game, by any stretch, but you can experiment more than it seems at first.   Here are my in-depth thoughts.   Starting with presentation, its visual style has probably grabbed your attention. If you know what you're getting into, it's very, very good. Expect still images, mostly textural, to give some more atmosphere to the writing.    It achieves that purpose with ease! Everything is in grayscale and seems to have been hand-drawn (with a lot of texture added), and it really sets the oppressive and gothic tone of this game.I have no complaints here, I really enjoyed just looking at some of the scenes.   The music was both great, and very limited, to be honest. Sound design was almost inexistent. There's one song (maybe 2) in the whole game. And while those songs do add to the mood, they're also very short, and often lead to silence for a few seconds, when you take longer to read. It was very atmospheric, sticking to the background.   A cool thing that could have been done was similar to the Bit Trip series, or even FTL, and it could be done with a single theme as well. Just make several layers or it. Using the same structure and melody, you can use several different instruments, with different intensities, etc., and switch them up to fit a particular scene. (In FTL, for example, the battle theme was the same as the travelling one, but with added percussion, and more aggressive in general) This is great for immersion and atmosphere, since it doesn't break the flow by switching songs, but it can also affect the atmosphere.  This is would have just been a nice addition, nothing worry-some!   Now, onto the game itself!   It has a very simple structure. You have 15 turns to explore the city of Istanbul. After those 15 turns, you'll go back to Vlad's castle. Each place you explore (event) takes one turn. The game is divided into 6 chapters. 5 of them in the city, and then the final one.   When you first begin, you can only explore 3 places in the city, with another 3 added in later chapters.   And that's basically it. You have 3 classes (each with different focal stats), with some events playing out different depending on it. The first 5 chapters, mechanically, are for you to increase the right stats as a result of your choices in those events. Some will go well, some will not. In the last chapter, your performance will highly depend on those.    One problem that comes with it, is that those events are more or less random (each area has different events, more likely to occur in different times of the game/turns). This makes it very hard to control how it will all turn out in the end, being almost a dice-roll, unfortunately. After several playthroughs, you'll get an idea of which choices are more favorable, but at the same time, it's not very fun at that point, as you can imagine. And the events may also be the ones you didn't want.   This may not have hurt the game very much, seeing that defeating the Boss is not the focus, but the journey there, and exploring the city's mysteries. However, there narrative design is probably the biggest issue here. You see, while there is an overarching story (with exposition at the end of each chapter) the actual \"meat\" of the game, in my eyes, is the other chained events that happen. Some of the events are self contained, but other are supposedly part of a chain. Maybe you find a clue early on, and you'll follow it later... This could lead to some really interesting paths. You wouldn't choose the place to go randomly, but in reaction to what you found out previously. Unfortunately, your actions have absolutely 0 impact, and makes for a very confusing world, since you'll find out what happened at the wrong points... There's no need to actually encounter the first event of a chain to encounter the last. And encountering the first does not help you to get to the others either. Which means that I've \"followed\" the events in different playthroughs. Maybe I'd find the 3rd on my first run, and on my second run I'd find the 2nd event, etc... Its design is all screwed up, from this perspective. There's no cause and effect. And once you realize what's going on, the game loses a lot of its appeal and becomes a confusing mess.   Now that I've explained the problem, here's a possible cause/solution. Each chapter has only 3 turns. That's very short for the player to leave an impact with each one. So, by making these longer, you could give the player a chance to follow and finish these chains, while having other random encounters as well. As it stands, there's just no room for everything, and it's not good at all. It just feels... incohesive? The exposition happens as if you were following a lead for a while, when you're actually encountering the situation for the first time. It's like reading a book while choosing chapters randomly, over the course of multiple playthroughs.   This is why I was going to recommend the game. In the first playthrough, I didn't understand everything, but I didn't see anything too wrong. The problems come when you're actually unveiling the mystery; you then see how flawed that is.   That's basically all that I have to say about Vlad the Impaler. Amazing art direction, for sure, and I really like the concept of the game. The mechanics, however, were not designed very correctly, from both a gameplay and narrative standpoint. I haven't played The Yawhg before, but it seems a better take on the concept, overall. Also, FTL and Weird Worlds are two games that use similar concepts, so you might want to try those before Vlad.   Here's hoping that the developers manage to solve all of these problems, learning from mistakes and eventually focus all the talent into a much better experience!",

        "text": "1849 is a game where you need to manage one city, leading it to prosperity in a very unique setting! As the name suggests, it's set in 1849, during the California Gold Rush. Your main focus, as you can guess, it mining for gold, as well as other minerals, and building full cities out of it (seldom self sustained; lots of trading with other cities is involved).   I'll make it clear right away that I have never played a city management game before, so my standards may be different from yours, as I have nothing to compare it to.    But I've found the setting to be interesting, and the game's aesthetic seemed to add to it well enough, so I bought it, and finish it. Here are my thoughts. Presentation   As you can see from the screenshots, this is no Tropico or SimCity with full 3D graphics, weather, and the sort. Not at all. As this is from a small team, they've opted for a more old school graphic style, with prerendered backgrounds and sprites. It may make the game seem very static, but each building has a sprite associated with a work-phase, and the townsfolk are also animated and walk around the city, delivering materials, going to the saloon, etc.    I think it looks really cool, and certainly not something you see a lot of. Everything seems to fit the setting (although I'm nowhere near an expert), and gives the game an unique vibe that works very well with its limitations. One problem is how blurry the sprites look when you zoom in a bit too close... Then, it looks a bit too rough. But you never need to zoom in as much, and it ends up looking great, for the most part! Well done here.   The music was good, but at the same time, a bit too repetitive. I like the western country it gives, adding to the atmosphere, but it's the same few tracks over and over again... Yeah, it ended up feeling too monotonous for me. What I ended up doing, was googling some other western country music (similar to what I heard in the game), and I stick to that instead. Unfortunately, I didn't find a lot from that time, which is a shame. It would be great if the developers could give the player some directions regarding finding other music, improving the overall experience for sure!   The sound effects were good for the atmosphere, but always ended up going overboard, leading to a cacophony of work noises or general gibberish. It can be annoying. I believe that each building played a sound, which lead to lots of different sounds being played at once, in busy moments... Since it felt like the same clip over and over, it wasn't very pleasant for me... But it's not too bad, you can turn it off easily.   Just another issue here, is the fact that there are no audio sliders of any sort. It's just SFX and Music On/Off (separately).The game was clearly designed for an iPad, and the interface shows that a lot, creating problems that should not exist in a PC game...   Now, about the game's structure. You have a campaign with 20 different missions, each consisting of a city. In these missions, you have a checklist of 3 different objectives needed to succeed. As you play, there will also be 2 \"surprise\" comissions from the Mayor. These are optional, but generally provide you with a small benefit, in the form of upgraded buildings for free (although only in that particular level). There should be achievements for these, but the only ones who work are in the last level. All the others don't register, so there's that...   At the start of each city, you'll also have 3 starting options, depending on your playstyle. Some give you more money, some open more trading routes, more food, mines, etc. etc. All things considered, they only seemed to affect the very beginning of each mission. Once you're set, they all play very similarly.   Different cities will have different trading routes, and different types of buildings you can build. This could have been great for variety, and increasing strategy, but it's flawed. First off, you have no infomation about it when you choose your starting conditions. This is BAD. Very bad. So many developers give the player uninformed decisions to make...!    Then, there are the comissions. There's also no information about these beforehand, which means that you'll be caught by surprise, usually with very little money, and having to change your whole approach if you want to meet those requirement. Why? Because the comissions usually ask for materials you have no use for! Half of the time you can't sell them, so you just build structures to get them in time, and then it's just wasted space. All for a few building upgrades... In hindsight, I probably would have been better off not doing them! Oh well...   The limitations imposed to you regarding the farms you can use also seems very arbitrary. There weren't any radical terrain changes to justify these, which means that it just felt a way of forcing you into different directions. The same with trading routes, I have no idea why I can't create more flexible paths to make perfect use of my resources... Maybe it makes sense from an historical standpoint, but that's never explained. barely anything regarding the Gold Rush is explained actually, which is disappointing!   Then, you have the Sandbox Mode. This sounds fun, right? Just building you city, endlessly expanding! ... Well, not quite. You see, you'll be able to choose different areas on the map, some larger, with more coastal area, more minerals, etc. But they're all pretty limited levels. And there's no objective at all. I understand what Sandbox means, but even some comissions would have been very welcome! There are not even random events that can happen to throw you off guard (at least none that I've seen)... So, it ends up being very laborious. You simply repeat what you've done during the campaign, but this time, with no goal. Just mindlessly clicking things, reaching for infinity... I really do think this was a missed chance. Comissions would have helped with variety, perhaps some bandits would increase robberies, earthquakes, I don't know... there are lots of possibilities, but I've seen none of them, so yeah.    I'd stick with the campaign, and no more.   Aside from all of this, the game just lacks challenge, as well as options. First, there's no automated trading. Which means that you'll have to buy everything manually (and selling), making it hard to keep a constant economic balance. Then, even if you want to check your stock, you'll have to open another menu to see that, with more tabs and clicks than it needs (because I'm playing this on a mobile device... Oh, wait.)...    Each road must be built one by one as well, as well as every building. I think it would have benefited a lot from a selection method to construct more than one at once. Or even giving shortcuts to the different buildings. I have lots of buttons on my keyboard, and none of them seemed to do a damned thing! There's a lot of clicking through menus here, unnecessarily so.   The lack of challenge comes mostly from the lack of good objectives, and monotonous progress. There are no events to make your life harder, you just keep building until you're infinitely rich! The only difficulty was in the comissions (mostly due to omission), and maintaining a large mansions at the end. That's because each requires a plethora of different resources that you'll have to constatly keep trading for. Without automation, it's very easy to let things slip while you're doing something else, and then everything downgrades because they're lacking shoes... Or newspapers... Because that's what defines a mansion.Sorry if I couldn't explain the mechanics all that well, but I've tried to focus on the negative points that I've found. I did not enjoy the game very much due to this lack of input from the player. It's just managing time and money, with no risk or reward. It's not awful, but not a great game!",

        "text": "The Bridge is another entry in the physics puzzle-platformer genre, and a quite ambitious entry at that!    It focuses on its one main mechanic, which is simply flipping the world, and its gravity with it. However, the levels are designed from the ground up to support it with a M. C. Escher-esque perspective, leading to some twisted and creative levels.   The game has 2 main sets, the second of which is a rework of the previous levels, with added elements that you learned to overcome in the first set. It seems a bit like an extended tutorial, as half of each chapter is about exposing a mechanic to the player, not being too challenging. The puzzles featured here are, in my opinion, better designed, and not difficult to actually finish once you know the solution.   The second, however, has a more physics-driven design, very unlike the first. This might leave you hanging a bit in the first few levels, but it's not as hard as it seemed after you realize that you actually do have to be more meticulous with the physics.   It also features a few secret Wisps (which help you interpret the story) and Achievements that can be frustrating to do if you're not using a guide, or maybe discussing clues with your friends. But none of it is mandatory, so it's a fair addition to the game.   The artstyle of the game is most likely its main draw. It's certainly very unique and it manages to merge its visual level design with the gameplay mechanics seamlessly.   If you're familiar with Escher's work, you'll certainly see where the inspiration came from! If you're not (like I was) this is certainly an opportunity to look into it, if you find this game's aesthetic interesting at all. It's certainly a great selling point, and it's always great when games manage to teach you something as subtly as The Bridge did.   The music, on the other hand, was disappointing to me. While the game is full of twisted perspectives and characters who are near madness, the music felt a bit underwhelming as a direct result. It's not bad, by any means. It's fairly minimalistic, with a few dissonant aspects to it (which I like), but I feel like the game would benefit more from something darker and more disturbing.    With that said, it still did its job, and added to the atmosphere.   The game mechanics all come down to rotating the world around you. Your goal is to reach a door, that is often locked. It can be unlocked by picking up a key, or activating a switch with one (or more) boulder(s). The objects in the levels are also subjected to gravity, however, not necessarily the same as yours. And it's basically about figuring out which path will lead a certain object where it needs to go, in often mind-bending and maze-like levels.   There are vortices (deactivated by a pressure plate), a curtain that negates gravity (so that you can rotate freely and change only the other objects' gravity), etc.   ...I almost forgot! There's also a rewind mechanic. And, of course, it made some people say the game tried to rip Braid off. Well... no. Not at all. Braid used time as its mechanic, and something needed to finish the puzzles. In The Bridge, it merely exists as a handy tool to let you undo mistakes without replaying the levels from the start.    The game has 4 chapters, each with 6 levels (and then there are an equal number of mirrored levels, which are harder and provide more plot elements -- don't consider the game finished without these!). Usually, the first 2-3 levels are about introducing a new mechanic to you, and the other 3 will use them in different ways, providing more challenging puzzles.   I'll admit that a few levels (especially later ones) proved to be a bit difficult. A problem I've had with it, is that it's very hard to actually visualize the solution to the puzzles. It came down to identifying different possible paths, and trying them out until I was close enough to the solution to be able to do the rest easily. I believe this is inherent to the level design, as everything is almost made to trick your eyes, making it a real pain to predict where each path will take you. Adding the fact that you're constantly rotating, which confuses you even more (and may provoke motion sickness, so beware!).   As I said, the later ones are more physics driven, and can be substantially harder if you're not used to it.   All in all, I actually felt somewhat rewarded for finishing it all without the use of a guide (except for the wisps). Some levels took me longer than I expected, but never being too frustrating.   And it was unique, so you should definitely give it a go, if you're into the genre. If you're not, it's probably not your best choice to start out, as there are other games which teach the player its tought-patterns better than The Bridge did (at least for me).  To end it, I just want to make a comment on the story and characters. At the end of each chapter, you'll get a sentence or two to give you a better idea of what's going on. Basically, it's a story about Escher and Newton working together. Escher, an almost mad artist, constantly trying to overcome reality, and Newton, a genius physicist, both using mathematics in unconventional ways.    It touches on finally finding someone as absurd as him, sharing interests, and then pursuing the impossible.   It's all very open to interpretation, of course, but I really liked the way it has been done. The achievements also add a bit to this, specifically the names of the ones you get from simply finishing a chapter (Thinker, Academic, Scholar, Challenger, Heretic, Outcast, Hermit, Genius)... It's definitely not the focus of a game, but I always think it's good when developers spread various elements across the game (not just in the levels, or direct exposition, but on little things like this).   If you haven't figured it out yet, I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre. How it bridges (heh) the visual and mechanical elements of level design is awesome, and it then coats it with interesting characters and themes that should make the player interested in knowing a bit more about what it's all about.   I've certainly enjoyed it more than I expected, and makes me look forward to the developers' next games!",

        "text": " Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a space scavenging/exploration game, with a few board game and rogue-like elements.    There are 3 different starter ships, each with a slightly different focus (alien ambassadors, military technology, ancient artifacts, etc.) and also different starting equipment.   The game was designed to be played in short bursts, each run being from 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how you do.   I'll say that I enjoyed the concept of the game, and it did entertain me for a while, but overall, the game left me wishing it had a bit more to it. If you're into these games, definitely give it a try, but don't expect to get too much out of it.   A sequel is in Early Access right now, so there's hoping that they can make it the bigger game it deserves to be!   Your role is to command your ship through the universe (Small, Medium or Large), exploring as many planets as you can to collect either artifacts or technology, and also recruit other ships to your fleet, perhaps. You can either hire them as mercenaries, or they may join you when in trouble.    These different ships will allow you to interact in a friendly manner with its race, if you encounter it later on.   You have a limited set time to do all this and return home. If you fail, you'll be lost in space and it's game over.   The maps also feature Nebulas (that highly diminish your travelling speed), and Black Holes (that will suck you in... and it's game over).   This game was released in 2005, I believe, but despite being nearly 10 years old, it has a clean interface and the graphics actually look pretty good! They could have fooled me. It's a simple looking game, but that's not a problem, in a game like this.   The item pictures are also cool looking, if not cheesy (to fit the game's humor).   The music is something I can't say much about. The menu music sounded good, but in-game, the music is very limited, with a few short clips playing along with certain encounters.   The sound effects were also a bit space-y, as one would expect, but nothing noteworthy, that I noticed.   So, I'll try to get you an overview of the game mechanics.   Like I said previously, the game is mainly about scavenging. You can equip your ship with things you find/trade, or you can keep things in your cargo bay, for later trade, or even use in your other ships.   Aside from these, there are artifacts (with flavor text about the game's universe) that are merely there to increase your score in the end, and other unique items with unique effects. One can switch your place with the ships in another planet, for example (this one was particularly fun when I had an item that resisted a black hole's pull, and thus spent the whole time sending ships into black holes by switching places with them).   You final score is calculated when you either die, or reach home safely, and in time. It's based on your cargo items and ambassadors, and each one has an associated value. Different ships also attribute different values to different types of cargo.   So, most of the time, you'll be travelling from planet to planet. Farther planets will take longer to reach (the time is always displayed to you), and when in a Nebula, the time increasing immensely.   You can change this if you come by different drives. Some of them are faster than other, some are fast in nebulas but slower outside them, and some even teleport you!   Other than that, you can have different encounters. Some planets are inhabited, and these can either bring you pain and tears, or generous traders. The ambassadors and mercenaries you carry can affect this.   There are also scanners that show you when a plant is inhabited, so that you can prioritize other planets to gather strength until you enter conflict.   The trading system is pretty simple. Each item has a certain value, and you can usually trade items of similar value (or type). There is also a race that accepts anything that is shiny, so you have a great opportunity to get great items at the price of nearly nothing.   The combat system, is something that I didn't quite understand (there is a combat simulator, by the way, so that you can explore this aspect of the game alone, with everything at your disposal). Most of the time, if you engage in combat, you'll be horribly murdered. So I ended up avoiding combat until I got certain items that would let me deal with the enemies in more... \"creative\" ways (such as teleporting them into black holes, or ramming them while invisible).Combat itself was mostly controlled by the AI (which can be improved with items you collect). You could only control your ships' path, but it would mostly play out by itself.    Again, I didn't quite understand it, mostly because I didn't need to. There were ways around it, which I think is a good thing!   And this is pretty much the game. There were a few random events that could happen (like an alien ship destroying every planet in its path -- and you being chosen to stop it; or a lady thief that could be captured if you had certain items), but these seemed to be pretty rare. Perhaps this problem is associated with the fairly limited replayability of this game, compared to, say, FTL.   And here's my reasoning.   This game lacks a bigger goal. In FTL, the tough Mothership fight was something that would keep you coming back to the game. And it was engaging for a good amount of time, until you succeeded.In Weird Worlds, however, it is really easy to end the game \"successfully\". The only drive would be discovering more about the universe, and improving your score. Coupled with the game sessions' short lengths, it's easy to see the game fail to keep you interested for that long.   Besides, there aren't as many items as one would hope. In my final playthroughs, I ended up with very similar sets of items, and thus making the game a bit too monotonous. But perhaps that's my problem by avoiding combat.   Overall, though, I enjoyed the game while it lasted. It did create some interesting situations, and sometimes made me feel like the Lord of the freakin' Universe. So I think it deserves some merit!   If you like the vibe of the game and my description of it (that I hope was accurate enough), give this one a try, I'm sure you'll have fun, even if for a short time. Now, there's a lot of room for improvement, so here's hoping that the newest addition to the series (Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars -- now in Early Access) manages to expand the game as it deserves!

        "text": "Enemy Mind is a 2D sidescrolling shooter with a twist: you don't have a ship of your own. Instead, you control other ships, doing as much damage as you can until you're nearly dead, or out of bullets... then, you just jump out into another ship.Pretty simple, huh? Well, with a decent variety of enemies, it creates some chaotic situations! It also has an interesting way of telling the story, although it's not very accessible for most people (as it requires you noticing it, and then replaying a lot of it).I'll say right away that I've had a lot of fun with it! I think it's an unique addition to the genre and certainly worth trying out if you like these kind of games.There's isn't all that much to say about presentation. It's clearly inspired by the older 8/16bit era, but it's a modernized version of it, with cool visual effects. It manages to stand on its own and not relying purely on nostalgia to look appealing.Every ship is distinguishable, which is needed for the player to know who to control at certain times. One problem I had, at times, is the blending between the bullets and the backgrounds. It didn't happen too often, but I did get killed a few times from bullets I couldn't see.The music was actually pretty awesome! It's also very modern sounding chiptunes. It packs a punch! Definitely get the soundtrack if you can, it's awesome, and adds to the whole atmosphere of the game.Now, about the game itself, starting with structure.You go through 8 levels, each subdivided into several waves. You have several lives, and you can gain more with combos, but once you deplete them all, you only go back to the beginning of the wave, having the chance to keep going from that point onwards with your score reset to 0.This makes the game forgiving for those who simply want to beat it, leaving the challenge for the score-attack audience, which is a great way of doing things, in my opinion!With that said, it still has a few challenging waves, and the game doesn't save your progress regarding the waves. You need to beat each level in one sitting (which isn't really a problem, since the levels aren't very long). At the end of each level, you'll see your place on the Leaderboards, with the surrounding players.In this case, I want to write about story-telling. Not a very common aspect that I take notice of, especially in an arcade game!But they've done it in an interesting way, so here it is...The game has 2 races in war, and you can possess ships from both. At the end of each wave, you'll get a short exposition, from the perspective of the race you're in control of. At the end of the level, the same happens, with a longer exposition.This means that to uncover the whole story of the game, you can't just go head first and shoot everything. It makes you fit the story pieces together, little by little. There are people on the community hub doing this and taking screenshots of the different plot scenes, if you're interested.While this is a confusing way of doing story (and will leave you with barely anything if you don't make an effort to uncover it), it's understandable. In this genre, the story isn't very important. Most players will care about beating the levels, not the backstory. However, if you're not like that, you have a little extra! Not caring doesn't diminish your enjoying of the game, but caring does certainly enhance it, so it's great!Finally, let's talk about the mechanics. There's isn't all that much to say about it, really.As I said before, you can take control of enemy ships, and you can shoot, and move around. That's pretty much it.Each ship has very limited ammo, so it constantly keeps you switching around. And each type of ship also has diferent movement/speed, and shooting patterns (some shoot all around, some are stationary turrets, some shoot vertically, some are stuck to the edges/ground, etc.).It's up to the player to evaluate each wave and act accordingly. It's generally not too difficult, with a few exceptions.The Boss fights were also a good change of pace, although 2 of them were recycled in a slightly harder version. I won't spoil the last Boss, but I'll say that it was a pretty fun fight!The downside (for some) is that going through the campaign once will probably not take you longer than 3 hours. But, in addition to the campaign (that you can easily replay, trying out different ships, piecing the story together, etc.) they also provide extra modes that you unlock through the campaign. One is an Arcade Mode, one is Boss Rush, once is a Rock Simulator (yes, you control a meteorite), an early prototype of the game, a flappy bird clone, and the Credits sequence (yes, you can shoot the developers!).So yeah. If you're into this sort of games, you have my whole-hearted recommendation! I really enjoyed playing through it, and there's certainly more content to keep you entertained, aside from the core campaign.Really cool game, well done!",

        "text": "Fist Puncher is a 2D beat 'em up game, highly inspired by the old 8/16bit era type of games like Streets of Rage and River City Ransom. And it certainly wears those influences on its sleeves. This game features very crude humor, which was amusing, for the most part, although it's probably not reason enough for you to play this game over any other. Still, it fit the theme well enough.I have only played the SP mode, so it might be a fun game to screw around in Local Coop for a short while.The graphics are very \"retro\" inspired. But, in this case, it's not retro in an innovative way... at all. The game looks quite ugly, in my opinion, but it certainly puts you in a similar mindset to when you played those older beat 'em ups, so hey... Personally, not a fan, but I don't mind it too much.You'll visit several different looking areas, keeping the levels somewhat fresh (although only visually).What I will say, though, is that the enemies don't really telegraph their attacks a whole lot. Every sprite movement is a bit too subtle for the player to notice when being attacked by a whole mob of them... This creates a bunch of problems, along with invincibility-frames and the mini-stuns. But I'll talk about that further ahead.I can't say much for the music, in this case. This is the type of game that I like to play while listening to my own music since immersion is not exactly the focus here, is it?The sound effects were pretty standard, but they gave that cheesy feeling of impact, as it should, so it's all good, here.Before moving on to the mechanics, I'll write about the structure of FistPuncher.This game has you go through a variety of stages (usually featuring a boss fight in the end), in order to save several of the Misses of the world. Typical damsel in distress affair(or... is it?). But hey, it's supposed to be cheesy and over the top.You have an overworld map with different paths, so you can tackle levels in different order, if you're having difficulty somewhere.You also have several characters to choose from. While each has its own backstory, the dialogue doesn't change at all, from what I've seen, so it's mostly a reskin.While they feature different moves, visually, they all behave very alike, which is unfortunate. Every character has the same type of moves, only changing one special ability (which is not that special), and their starting attributes.And speaking of attributes, this also has a progression system, giving the game some very light RPG elements (not as unique as River City Ransom did, though). By killing enemies, you'll gain experience, and occasionally level up. By doing so, you'll earn points to spend in attributes (Strength, Speed, Defense, Special Meter and Health Pickups), and also gain Perks. These don't change the game very much. Essentially, they just give you a special ability to choose from, and multiple lives later on.All in all, it felt very shallow, since it barely altered gameplay, aside from the numerical standpoint. And it had one giant flaw:The fact that experience was NOT shared. So, once you leveled up a character, you'll be making all other characters weaker by comparison. Which means that if you want to try out the different characters, you'll have the replay the levels to get to the same level. Otherwise, you'll just change to a weaker character that takes way too long to kill enemies, for no reason.This is really bad design, from my perspective.It renders the characters completely useless, in single player. Sure, it can be used to give the game replayability, but the game already stretches itself way too thin by having an 8 hour campaign that gets very repetitive...It would have been much greater if it gave a shared pool of point to apply to different characters. That way, the player could feel free to try every character at will, right after unlocking them, and without feeling much weaker. I don't understand this design choice... if you think it's no big deal to you, then it's fine. I don't.So, how's combat itself?Well, very basic. You punch fast, kick slowly, run and jump. Then you have a couple of special abilities, which are usually limited to a Dash attack, and Spin attack, and a projectile. There are also jump kicks and things like that, but overall, the combat was very spammy. And you don't really need to try and change your strategy around. It's basically about using the Dash attack while you have stamina, knicking enemies down and jumping onto them. You can also grab enemies, but since you're always assaulted by a bunch of them at once, it proves to be useless, and you're better offer just attacking multiple enemies at once.And unfortunately, the majority of the game plays like that. All the enemies are VERY similar, although some had guns, others dodged a bit more, some self-exploded, etc. But they barely required different approaches. And do make things worse, every difficulty option just played the same! Instead of creating harder battle situations, with different types of enemies, they simply increased their attributes, thus making it harder. An uninteresting and uninspired way of doing difficulty, in my opinion.Then, there's the stun and hitbox problem. Bosses are usually just bigger versions of the standard mobs (with a couple of exceptions, of course), but since they're huge, you can just attack their head, and they'll be unable to attack you, since you're above their range.As I said previously, you can't tell very well when enemies are stunned or not, so, if you try to combo your attacks, you'll simply be attacked back, out of nowhere, with no chance of escape. And Bosses can very easily 2 hit you, so that's not a good option, is it?So, again. Just jump around, use the Dash attack and punch him 2-3 times at most. Then run away. And repeat. And it's about 5-6 hours of this. It feels way too generic to me. The game didn't seem to try and make gameplay interesting in any way. It took the classic beat 'em up formula, and used it straight up, with close to no addition.Well... that doesn't make a very good game. That game isn't awful or anything, and I enjoyed it when I started out. But it just drags, and drags... The characters could have altered that, but didn't. The progression system could have been interesting. Again, missed the target. So, you're left with very little.Then, there are a few deviations from the typical level design. There's a level in which you ride an ostrich through a desert mine field. Dude, that's badass! You simply have to focus on dodging the mines on the ground. But then again, you die in 2 hits... I personally didn't have a problem with this level in particular, but some people did.Then, there's a level in which you have to attack the thugs, but avoid hitting the lawyers, or they'll sue you. And one punch equals to a failed level, and you'll have to restart. The problem is that the AI of the lawyers is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 annoying. Seriously. There are more lawyers than enemies on the screen, in a small space, and they jump in front of you out of nowhere. I spent waaay too long in this level. It made no sense, the way it was implemented. And there were a lot of frustrating levels like that.While the idea of breaking up the pacing is very nice, the levels didn't seem to be very well tested, and ended up being a frustrating mess, for the most part.There are levels about deactivating bombs, trying to send ninjas off of a truck's roof, etc.Some were funny, and I liked the ideas! But the execution was poor.So yeah. If you really like any kind of beat 'em up, then give this one a go. It's not awful. But if your standards are a bit higher, look another way. It does everything \"by the book\", with little to no innovation, and even the basic mechanics are dubious, with dodgy hitboxes and stun-frames. It also stretched itself thin.",

        "text": "Deadlight is an old-school 2D platformer in the vein of Prince of Persia and Flashback, set in post-apocalyptic Seattle, in which you'll also have to either fight, or find your way around the zombies.While the game isn't groundbreaking in any way, it entertained me while it lasted, despite having some clear mechanical flaws.I've played it with a controller, since it's a console port, and most people seem to find the keyboard controls unintuitive and unresponsive.Let's start with the presentation.The graphics are certainly the highlight of Deadlight. Despite being a 2D game, every scene was completely done in 3D, creating really deep and detailed backgrounds that are great to look at, and provide a good atmosphere!One issue some people may have is the color scheme, as everything is gray-ish brown, giving it the typical post-apocalyptic look. But there are a few points where the game is colorful during the main character's memories.There are also some well put filters during the character's mental breakdowns.Overall, the game looks really great! The cutscenes have a more comic book style, but they're still pretty good.The music was very, very minimal from what I could tell. It added to the atmosphere, but it was too quiet for me to notice it too much. Which fits the kind of game that it is, I'd say, so nothing wrong sound-wise either.A good addition is a bunch of development videos, concept art, and even a diary (that you complete by playing the game)! These certainly add value to the game, and give you a reason to explore the levels.If you're generally interested in the developing process, have this in mind.Well then, let's talk about the mechanics.This is where the game falls a bit short of expectations.While it's not a bad game, it doesn't innovate all that much, and does feel all that great to control.Mainly, you go from area to area by platforming around the place, running and jumping through roofs and cars, with the occasional indoor sections.You'll have an Axe, a Revolver, and a Shotgun. Outside of that, you'll have to use the environment to kill or stall the zombies. And it works pretty well, in my opinion. I ended up playing too conservatively regarding ammunition, and made some situations harder on myself. While the game expects you to scavenge for ammo, you never really hold these weapons for long periods of time to make it matter too much.One problem I've had overall, was that the controls were a bit clunky and unresponsive. They were slow, and while giving a feel of weight to the character's movements, it could get frustrating when you were stuck to an action that you knew was going to kill you.And the platforming felt very similar. Everything was a bit too slow and heavy, and it's aggravated by far from perfect grasp on ledges and imprecise wall jumping.Despite these shortcommings though, the game knew its limitations, and was very forgiving with its checkpoints (with an added Nightmare mode for beating each Act without using any checkpoints, after beating the game), so it didn't get to be very frustrating for me. There was a significant delay between death and respawning that I could see getting annoying to many people. It's no Super Meat Boy in that regard. But it's not supposed to be, I'd say.The game also breaks up the platforming and running away from zombies with some very simple puzzles. Nothing too complicated or dragged out, these consisted mainly of moving a box, unlocking a gear, etc.One issue I've had with it, is when it comes to traps. Sometimes, the foreground and background blended a bit too much, which often led to death. And there was quite a bit of that. Some sections required trial and error instead of quick reflexes (since inertia is a very real thing in Deadlight), and it's generally not very good design.But, outside of that, I think this is an entertaining game to play for a low price. It's short, it's not very innovative, but it's still a pleasant experience. I've found the plot to be very generic, but all the added collectibles, diary pages and other souvenirs manage to deliver it in a refreshing way.There are much better games out there, but this is certainly not bad. If it looks like your cup of tea, give it a go! ",

        "text": "Sweet Lily Dreams is a JRPG that is highly influenced by popular stories, and wears those in its sleeves. Quite literally.The game's focus is clearly its universe and story, but it tries to tie the RPG mechanics into it without really understanding them... and so the \"game\" part ends up dragging for way too long, and had me lose interest in the story completely, about 15 hours in.I still finished it, but while the very last mission was better than the others, it still wasn't great, and definitely not worth it.The game has a few cool ideas, but it's far too ambitious for what it ends up doing, and feels like a mess the whole way through.RPGMaker games get a bad reputation, and it's totally understandable! I'm pretty sick of playing these games on a small resolution because the engine can't handle any better. And yet, this is sold for 15\u20ac. No. I could overlook the technical issues, if the game had good mechanics, but this is one just has a unique artstyle, with a fairly uninspired story (in my opinion).There's A LOT wrong with this, and I can't write about everything, but I'll sum it up the best I can.So, presentation.RPGMaker problems aside, it's not bad.While the UI is a bit generic, the actual game's resources are mostly unique, and certainly gives Sweet Lily Dreams a headstart when compared to its competitors.It has a very twisted fairy-tale feel to it, and it works well!The combat animations and particle effects were very simple and limited, but it didn't really matter to me.It's good, but nothing spectacular.The music felt a bit incoherent, to me. While it wasn't bad, it sounded very generic, and I don't feel it complemented the artstyle in any way. Take it or leave it. Personally, I didn't care for it, and I'm one to appreciate video game music, most of the time.Before going into the mechanics, I'll talk about how the story plays out.Essentially, you play as Lily, and you're trapped in a dream world. In this world, there are forces fighting that behave almost like secret corporations/cults... it feels out of place, and there's very little insight into them. While the game throws a bit of moral gray into this conflict, it never develops it.There are hints between who's right and wrong, but it's pointless. You never explore either sides very much, character progression was very shallow, and the player had no hand on it. I saw a few opportunities for moral choices, but no. It's as linear as it gets. And it's not that well written.So, other than that, you'll go from mission to mission, with a few party members, to prove your worth, and later fight the main antagonist. Each mission is from someone's dream. Or story. These stories are drawn from literature, comic books, etc. I'm not sure how I feel about this. In a way, I like when games/series do this. But it felt very arbitrary in this game. The missions had absolutely no connection to each other, and ended up feeling like an excuse for not writing original stories. (You know, some futuristic animes discuss some classic sci-fi concepts and problems, and reference books/movies for their origins, or other perspectives. This game, however, references them for the sake of it. Personally, I have no interest to look into those stories because of the game.)Besides, it can alienate some people, if they've never heard of those stories. The game gives very little context to them, expecting you to have the same past as the developers to enjoy it...Honestly, I don't think it's very good. Many people seem to disagree with me, so I may be in the wrong. But personally, the game felt like it wanted to have some idealism behind it, but didn't go the whole forward.So... so far, nothing very good. And with the combat and puzzles, things only get worse.First, the combat. In the first half hour of the game, you have only one character, with one basic attack. This means that you'll spend half an hour spamming the basic attack, while learning absolutely nothing abou the mechanics.Then, you gain a skill! But... it's just a physical attack, slightly stronger than the basic one. It's adds nothing to the game.You get the drill... It's pretty tedious. The game doesn't really give you a wide array of tools to experiment with. It's all so primitive... There are 4 elements that counter each other. However, there's no visual indication of which type your enemies are, which means that you'll have to use every elements until you figure out what the best tactic is. Simple trial and error. That's the first problem.Then, every elements behaves exactly the same, with the exception of the ailments. Each element has one, which could provide some more strategy. There damage over time (Poison-Water), Blind(Miss chance - Thunder), Burn (Silence-Fire) and Freeze(Cold). These could be cool... but turns out that all the bosses are immune to these. And the normals enemies die fast enough that you don't need to use them. So, the only defining trait of each elements is utterly useless. Big problem for me.So yeah. The combat gets very repetitive. It's just trying to figure out each enemy's weakness, and then use the most powerful attack you've got.There's also very little sinergy between the party members, it's limited to physical/magic defense for the party, and a very, very weak healing ability.The loot is limited to crafting materials for both spells and furniture. (more on furniture later)Equipment is just one acessory per character, and will boost one stat. That's all. You main character can have a Weapon (elemental attack) and a Dress(elemental defense). Even these two were badly implemented!You choose your weapon and dress at the beginning of the game. It's the first thing you do. With absolutely NO CONTEXT for what these you, you're given a choice... It makes no sense. You can buy the other elements later from a story, but there's no point anyway, and you won't be able to in the start of the game.On a segway, do not choose Thunder. The first 2 missions contain enemies and bosses that are immune to this elements, which means that one of your characters will be useless for the first couple of hours. Really smart way of doing things....I'm sorry for being overly negative, but it seems that I've stumbled across a major design flaw in every single step of the way. I'm not purposely trying to make the game look bad, but I can't see almost no redeeming values!There's also an optional puzzle elements to the game, needed only for sidequests. But guess what... Yeah, it's not very good.Each level has a different type of puzzles to solve (it can be a pipe-puzzle, and slide-puzzle, etc. etc.) These could have been cool, but they're just... there. And they usually stretch out for way too long, and go from being a change of pace to a shore.Also, since this is not a puzzle game, it doesn't slowly teach you, gradually increasing difficulty. Either you're familiar with these puzzle and solve them easily, or you're not. It's feels out of place.I don't think there much else to say. The game also feels completely unbalanced. I was playing on Hard Mode fairly okay. Then, due to the limited elemental spells (which you'll take a long time until you learn), I reach a point where it was impossible for me to win. The enemies could Blind and Freeze me, and half of my characters were powerless. It was literally impossible, until I lowered to Normal.Another balance issue, is regarding money. At the start of the game, you'll barely have money for potions. By the end, you'll have a lot of money, but the potions don't heal you enough to be useful in battle.It's just... I don't know. I don't know who balanced the game, honestly. It's just not good. At all.No more words for furniture (sorry for the rant). But just know that it was a bad replacement for equipment. Sorry, I didn't enjoy this game at all, and definitely not recommend it.",

        "text": "Mini Ninjas feels like a throwback to the PSX and N64 era, with games like Banjo Kazooei, Super Mario 64, Medievil and so on.It's a 3D Action Platformer, designed to have open levels, with collectibles spread all over.While the game's description (on this page) is not entirely wrong, it can be deceiving. First off, if you're looking for a Stealth game, do not get this one. While stealth is possible, it's neither encouraged by the level design, nor very useful.The enemies are not designed to be approach silently, nor do the rooms have several possible entries and exits. It's not that type of game.It's more of a game designed for children, with a very lighthearted story, levels and Boss fights. Which isn't necessarly a bad thing.Let's talk about presentation first.Despite being a game from 2009, it's looks great!The cartoony style fits well with the game's vibe, and everything looks very clean and smooth. No complaints here whatsoever, except for the background's resolution. For some reason, their resolution is noticeable lower, and feels weird to look at. But it's a minor complaint!It achieves the japanese looks very well, and uses simplicity to its advantage.The music is also really good, and complements the theme perfectly. It's not something that will be stuck in your head or anything, though. It's \"merely\" textural music, that adds a lot to the atmosphere and feels quite relaxing.During the more action-driven sections, the Taiko drums will also come in for a decent adrenaline rush. Overall, pretty good!One issue, though. Sometimes, the sound would start glitching for no apparent reason, making the game sound like System Shock instead of a ninja/samurai-themed game. I don't know what caused it, but just take that in mind.So far, so good! Why am I not recommending this game, then? Well, the level design and game mechanics don't fit very well together, unfortunately, which leads to an experience that gets repetitive very quickly.First off, the combat is very button mash-y. You have a normal hit, and a heavier hit, to stun blocking opponents. You can also run and jump. There are very few possible combos with these attacks, as can be imagined, which makes every fight be very much the same. You'll also unlock spells and other ninjas throughout your journey, as well as potions.The different ninjas are a great idea, but their execution is very flawed. Each ninja has a different special ability, and weapon. These can differ in range, speed, damage, etc. There's a ninja with a big hammer, one with claws, one with a spear, a bow, etc. And this could have been used very effectively! But it's not. Why? Mainly, because the appropriate situations and placed right when you get said character. And you can use them there pretty well. But throughout the rest of the game, their usefulness is very limited, and you're better off just using the normal ninja. Spells are useful, and more fun to use on large groups of opponents, but very rarely are necessary. Only the basic ninja is able to use them as well, which further limits the other ones. (You can switch between them at will, but it's still not worth the hassle).The potions are also a big flaw in the game, in my opinion. With the exception of Health potions, you have absolutely no reason to use them! They're not useful, nor necessary at any point in the game. To that, add that you'll have to use them from the menu, which means pausing the game and looking for the right one. It simply breaks the pacing, without a benefit. You can use keybindings for some potions, but those will most likely be in use for the spells already.It could have been a great addition, but there are no situations that ask for the use of these potions, so it's just a game mechanic and is left unused throughout. A waste of space, sorry to say.You can either get these by finding them in the levels, buying them from vendors, or crafting them with plants that you'll gather. So, now that the main mechanics are out of the way, let's talk about level design.There are 22 levels, 5 of which are Boss Fights. In each of them, there are 5 things to look out for: Spells, Plants, Coins, Statues, and Caged Animals. Aside from reaching the end of each level, you may want to collect these items.This leads to levels being very open, with these items spread throughout. Unfortunately, unlike, say, Super Mario 64, none of the levels was very interesting. In Mario, every level had a lot of different content, with different areas, character, challenging platforming sections, racing, etc. etc. Every single level was crafted carefuly.In Mini Ninjas, the levels are mostly bland. The items seem \"hidden\" randomly, transforming exploration into tedious walking. Besides, there doesn't really seem to be any reward by collecting these. While you can use the plants for crafting, and coins to buy potions/tools, these are never really useful, so, once again, it's wasted space.The same goes with the caged animals, which you can free for kindness alone, without any reward.While some levels to have different sections, the game drags for too long, starting about halfway through it. There are river rapids and an avalanche sections, in which you'll have to dodge rocks and trees at a high speed, but aside from those, all the levels play very similarly. (They do look differently, though, so that's good. There are mountains, snow, rice plantations, etc. etc. decent variety)Enemy variety is also questionable. Some enemies require somewhat different approaches, but not something enough to provide challenge. I've played it on Hard Mode, and you can certainly steamroll through the whole thing without much of a problem. This, once again, leads to a not very interesting game.Finally, let's talk about the Boss fights.The last fight was great! You had to use the different spells at your disposal to beat him, which took a couple of tries to get the strategy. The other ones, unfortunately, were just a question of baiting them, followed by a QTE section.You would observe their behaviour, until you got what to do to \"unlock\" the QTE. And then just to the same thing 3 times and you're done. It's a shame. Boss fights can usually be really interesting and different, but this game didn't seem to seize that opportunity very well.I've written enough.While I feel that Mini Ninja's heart is on the right place, its execution leaves a lot to be desired. It could have been a very fun game if it had used all its mechanics appropriately, or simply making a more condensed experience.Since it doesn't, I can't recommend this game at all. Wait for A Hat in Time, perhaps, if you're itching for this kind of gameplay!",

        "text": "140 is a very \"primitive\" platformer, if not for the seemless implementation of the music into its level design.It's great to see such a concept used this well and while simple, and very short, it's almost perfect it what it does.Beware, I beat the game in about 1 hour. After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)The game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!As usual, presentation!140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical \"2D retro pixelated graphics\" that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style. It never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly.I really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole \"atmosphere\".It's hard to talk about its music without talking about the gameplay at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.As I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of. All your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets.Well, how can you still make an unique game with that?Music!Similarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.Another game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!I've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!Another noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it teaches you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse!Sometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges.I never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret! After you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.Every big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller \"level\", something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight. It is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!Another thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah.But it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated.It really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.One nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!I could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!All in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about. I'm really surprised about it, great little game!If you're a bit skeptical of the 5\u20ac it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.",

        "text": "First off, I have absolutely no experience with the XCOM franchise, so I can't say how the plot stands with the other games, or how faithful the universe is.Besides, I haven't played a tactical TPS in a long time, which means that I may overlook some aspects that avid players of the genre look forward to.But here are my general thoughts. I'll try not to be too detailed, since AAAs have such a bigger scale compared to what I'm used to playing.So. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is a tactical third person shooter, set in the 60's, in the first alien invasion of Earth. The best of the best are united in the XCOM to fight this invasion, and cover it up to protect the population.You'll go through several missions (some minor, some major), and you'll get to know the people you're working with between each, in the base.You have a squad of 3 people (you, and 2 AI partners), that you have some control over, during the fights. There are different classes in the game, and with each come different skills to aid you in battle. Some are support focused (providing shields, damage buffs, etc.), engineers (focus on tech, turrets, etc.), artillery (with long range deadly shots), you get the drill.Each of them can be leveled up to rank 5, and you go as far as rank 10. With each rank you choose 1 of 2 perks (sometimes, 1 of 1... tough choice, there).Let's start with the presentation.It's a AAA game, and that's very clear. Everything looks really nice, and it felt the theme surprisingly well, with the lighting effects giving the game an old sci-fi feel! Other parts of the game looked more generic, unfortunately. But overall, it certainly looked great, with good particle effects, lighting, and physics. The music also fit the theme very well, both the 60's feel, and the sci-fi. Unfortunately, it was very far apart. I don't feel like they've used the music very effectively, specially in the tense and emotional moments, the music in those was simply underwhelming.Overall, it didn't really feel as unique as it could have. As a AAA, it did very little to standout, despite being pretty good aside from that.One thing it did well in the beginning, was portraying the time setting well, using posters, and even the conversations with the different people.Moving on. The gameplay started out pretty good, but the probems soon started to reveal themselves. I chose to play in Commander Difficulty at first. The problem with that, was the friendly AI. They died within 4 seconds of the start of the fight. And I'm not exaggerating!If I sent someone to revive them, they'd just stand in the middle of the shots and would die as well. And that was pretty much the experience. That kind of challenge wasn't welcome at all. I spent way more time trying to keep my squad alive than fighting! So... after about 5 missions I decided I had enough with it, and turned it to Veteran. I died twice in the whole game after that. Once in the last mission, with throws wave after wave of enemies after you.There's just such a big discrepancy between Hard and Very Hard... that's not a very good balance, in my opinion.   Commander mode could have been really strategic and tense, if the AI was worth something.       Unfortunately, it was really bad. And you could see in the end, comparing their kills to yours. You alone did about 95% of the job, so yeah...   Other than that, it wasn't bad. You had several different weapons at your disposal, different enemies had to be taken out in different ways (not too different, but a bit different nonetheless), the skills lead to some nice teamwork... I wasn't bad!   It was not spectacular, but I was fairly enjoyable.   As I said before, between missions, you'll be in the Hub Area. Here, you can talk to the scientists, engineers, pretty much everyone, and get their view on the invasion. You'll also know why they're there, and what they're working on. That was cool. It didn't blow my mind, but it's good that it's there, if you feel like exploring a bit more.   There are also Notes, Photos, and Audio\"Logs\" spread out, during the breaks between battles. These also give you a bit more insight into the world, which is always good!   Something that really bothered me though, was the Audio Logs. You had to stand near to listen to it. ... Why? The whole point of audio logs is to keep the player exploring, while being presented with the backstory. And they managed to screw it up, and have you stop your playing to listen to it... It makes no sense! Might as well give you a note instead of an audio log... I don't understand.   There's not much else to say about it, really. The cover system works fine, for the most part. One complaint I have, is that you can't roll into cover! That's really important, in my view! You can roll out of the way fine. But if you roll into cover, it doesn't connect, so you'll stand up, fully vulnerable, after rolling. And you'll take unnecessary shots. I don't see why it's not in there either, but oh well...   I may seem overly negative about the game, for a positive review. The fact of the matter is, that it mostly functions very well. The gunplay is solid, movement in fluid, combat involves some level of tactic, while ordering your squad members, ...   It's not a bad game at all. It's simply not a very good one either, and for full price, I definitely do not recommend it. But if you're curious about the setting, or you're a fan of XCOM, I don't see a problem in getting in a sale, or something along those lines.   The character interactions, though, were really bad in my opinion. And so was the way they handled the ending. SPOILERS HERE. So, while you were playing with one character for the whole game, learned about his intentions, played his role, they decided to switch things up. In the end, you had to choose another character to control. (You're an alien controlling them,  basically) You had 3 choices that were not very well explained. Nor well executed, with the past they set up.   The new character played exactly the same way as the previous one! You go from a badass field agent to a scientist who barely every fought, and they have exactly the same abilities and skills! It makes no sense whatsoever! And they also expect you to make the choices you've made with the previous character, as if they were the same... Depending on the character you choose, you'll get a different ending, based on each person's ideals, and that was good. But aside from that one cutscene in the end, it felt a very shallow choice. And even before that, there was ONE seemingly important choice... Well, it was just a cameo. There was no choice at all, it was all an illusion. And a pretty bad one. Oh well.    Overall, I expected more. But for the price at which I got it, it was a fine game. Won't change the world in any way, but it was enjoyable.",

        "text": "Ballpoint Universe - Infine is a small indie game with a beautiful artstyle, as you can see from any screenshot.It has 2 components. First and foremost, it is a shoot 'em up game. Its story, however, is told through a 2D platformer, between the shooting sections.Overall, I think it fits the price, as a game. Despite being beautiful, its mechanics aren't too noteworthy (although not at all bad), and it has a few technical and design issues. On the other hand, it looks amazing, and it does a good job of entertaining you for a few hours.Let's start with its presentation.Everything in this game is hand-drawn. It has a very surreal style to it, even psychadelic, at times. But it fits the theme.The texture work is impressive, with the weird patterns fitting all together, and the NPC and Boss design is also great! Everything seems out of this world and yet beautiful. This is all well and good, but it has a few issues. First off, and this comes to the scale of this game, is the fact that some textures look low res, there are a few conflicts that lead to graphical bugs, and the fact that everything is a plane gives it a very fragile feel, at times. Just a little bit of depth (like cardboard) would have helped it.But it still looks very good! And the issues are most likely because of its budget, so I don't want to be too harsh on it.All that was regarding the platformer side. On the shoot 'em up side, the only issue I've had is the fact that the enemies explode into some very obstructive textures. This means that when you're surrounded by enemies, you'll often get killed by something that you literally can not see, and it's annoying, at times.But that's my main issue with it. There's a very clear distiction between the background and foreground, and the levels look quite good.Another minor thing is that the enemies have some parts of their body that do damage to you, and other that don't. Unfortunately, there's no visual distinction between these, which is a problem, specially with Boss Fights, whenever you need to get closer. Also, despite the player having a small hitbox, it usually blends with the rest of the ship, making it very hard to do some tight dodges. Simply giving it a different color would have helped a lot. But hey, it didn't detract too much from the game.Music and SoundEffects didn't really do much for the game, in my opinion. They weren't bad, but I think they should've gone one step further with it. They felt a bit generic, and did very little to enchance the very surreal sense of the art style, in my opinion. There's also the lack of separate audio sliders. It's just lazy.Before going over the gameplay itself, let's talk about the interface and controls.The interface was pretty simple, but was surprisingly good. Whenever you paused the game, you would have a lot of info at hand right away, regarding missions, collectibles, changing the controls, going into infinite mode (more on that later), etc. Everything was a click away, so good job on that!The controls, on the other hand, were a really big issue. This game has some of the weirdest control schemes I think I've seen in a while. You have 3 options: Mouse, Keyboard, or Gamepad. The Gamepad felt like the Mouse, and made it even harder to navigate the menus.Mouse and Keyboard were good and serviceable, on 2 separate parts. For the platforming sections, the mouse is almost impossible. Know how you pan out the screen in a RTS, or MOBA? Well, it's the same here. You drag the mouse to move the character, and click to jump/interact. It doesn't work. At all. It's so imprecise... I have no clue why this is here. It makes no sense. For this section, the keyboard is significantly better, although the character still bounces around a lot, and the platforming hitbox is dodgy. The moving platforms also interact very weirdly with the character, everything feels just... awkward and bad. And that's unfortunate. But, for the most part (not all), the developers were aware of this fact, and kept platforming to a minimum.For the shmup part, the mouse works really well. Simple move it to move your ship, and click to shoot. Simple and effective. The keyboard however, doesn't work very well. Because of this, you'll be constantly switching between control schemes... And this issue hasn't been fixed at all, so beware.Alright, gameplay then!There's not much to be said regarding the platforming. It's mostly just a vehicle for the story, and to show you how beautiful their art is. There are Golden Sketches scattered around the world that you may want to collect (for compeltionist's sake), but other than that, you're there to look around, and talk to the different characters, learning more about the world and its people. The story was pretty straightforward and wacky, but in a good way.For the most part, there's barely any platforming, unless you're looking for the sketches. To reach some, there's some more precise platforming. And that way is okay. It still feels really bad, but it's not in the way. Unfortunately, in the later sections of the game, there is some more obligatory platforming. And it shows how bad it is! There are some bad physics interactions, you'll get stuck several times, etc, etc. It's bad. And I don't know why they decided to go back with their design choice and put platforming into it! It only hurts the game.The shooting is far more interesting. You have an infinite mode (with 60 balanced waves, after that is just madness), and you have the story missions. It did not enjoy the infinite mode. The story missions were pretty fun, though.By completing missions and destroying enemies, you'll collect Ink. You'll use this to buy more parts for your ship, and also upgrade them. This is shared between the 2 modes. The missions rewards you for your performance (perfection will also get you a Golden Sketch). And these are the best way of getting said Ink. The missions are far more rewarding, and let you experiment quite a lot with the parts. The infinite mode, however, doesn't reward you with much, so you're just playing the same thing over and over. (You can spend a special coin to start out from the place you died, and you get these by defeating bosses, so you'll progress quite quickly, which avoids repetition)The missions, on the other hand, feel far more different from one another, both visually, and gameplay-wise. Some are just defeating waves of enemies, while others have environmental hazards that require timing to avoid. I really enjoyed completing the missions and getting all the rewards.You have 2 weapon slots, a body, and a special move. There are melee, ranged, and also shields, as weapons. The body provides more health, and one of 4 different effects. The special move is like a finisher.The melee is far riskier, but also deals heavy damage, and destroyes shield. This was my favourite playstyle, and it felt different from most shmups because of it! Some blades did forward damage, some damage all around the ship, wide arcs, etc. There's good variety here! And the same with the guns. Unfortunately, the game doesn't get to show you everything before feeling very grindy and unrewarding, which is a huge issue for me.While doing the story, it's great! You'll try out 3-4 combinations. After that, however, the ink payment is very low, and you're not pushed into trying out the different weapons, which would have been the joy of discovery in this game! Well, but it isn't. And that's very unfortunate.Enemy and Boss variety is really great as well. Lots of different bullet patterns, some will try to melee you... more variety than I expected!Overall, give it a go! It has lots of issues, but its incredible visuals are worth the price tag. It's a great example of a small indie idea enhanced a bit to make it a full game! ",

        "text": "Bardbarian \"is a mixture of Tower Defense, RPG & RTS with some 'Shmup and Snake elements\". I have no clue where the RTS element is.It's essentially a game about defending your town crystal from incoming waves of enemies. How do you defend it? You summon party members with different abilities, and you run around dodging bullets and buffing your party (you do not control your attacks, that's all done automatically).When I saw this game, I thought it looked interesting enough to give it a go. The reviews were surprisingly positive, so... why not?I'll just say that I was extremely disappointed with this game, and the reviews are unbelievable. I honestly don't know why people think this is a good game of PC! Here's a more lengthy analysis.First off, presentation.The graphics look a bit average to me, but they're fine. What you see is what you get (from the screenshots). One problem with it, is that it's highly repetitive, even visually, since you have only one map for the campaign. And it doesn't really change its look. Other modes have different maps, but nothing beautiful or interesting. They're fine. That's all I can say about it.The music was actually not bad. It's almost neo-classical metal, instrumental only. Unfortunately, there's only one song on the campaign. The song loops the entire time, which can (and does) get repetitive after listening to it hours on end. The song loops pretty seemlessly, so that's good (from what I could tell). It was just background music, didn't really add to the experience. There were no volume sliders either. Only music/sound-effects on/off.Very limited overall. A bit more effort and it could have been much more enjoyable, but playing the same track over and over and over... not good.The interface was fine. The mouse support works fine on the menus. I played the game with a Gamepad and it worked well as well, so good job on that. Unfortunately, the concept of an Options Meny seems to be very foreign to the developer. There's barely anything, which is really annoying. But hey, at least it had rebindable keys!It's.. again, fine. Nothing noteworthy here, it's missing a bunch of options, but it didn't really prove to be a problem, in my experience.So, how's gameplay?Well, it's a grindfest. Almost a waiting game...As I said, you don't actually attack. So, your whole job is to summon party members, and run around the map, getting close enough for your party to attack. You can also boost the party with +Attack, +Speed, +Defense, or a special Stun ability. If your party member dies, you'll have to summon them again, at a cost. If you Bard dies, or your Crystal is destroyed, you lose. Simple enough. To summon units and use buffs, you'll need to gather \"Notes\". You gain a few over time, and you get some more from enemy drops, sometimes.And that's pretty much it, as gameplay. Enemy variety was pretty good. They'll shoot at you, with some of them being faster, some firing multiple shots, in multiple directions, etc. It felt inspired by The Binding of Isaac (in a good way). That's not to say that the enemy variety is even remotely closer. Not at all. There are about 10 different enemies, and some of them are fairly similar. So, all you have to do is literally run around, for the most part. And it gets very old, very fast. It's clearly designed as an iOS game... And a lazy one.It does have some bullet hell elements. And those could have saved the game! But, there's a huge problem with that. As I mentioned, you have units. These run around you. Which means that your hitbox is huge, and very inconsistent. You simply can't do those awesome dodges you would in a bullet hell. There's no way. There's an upgrade on the shop for the party to stick closer together, but it barely helps... Everytime you move, they'll stay a bit behind, which would be fine, but it provides nothing of worth! It simply inutilizes most of the dodging. Which means that you'll always play safe, run around, not feeling like a badass.That's all the gameplay is. Running around. The Boss fights were significantly better, but still not very good. A few simple patterns, but they at least felt more refreshing.The second part of this game, is the upgrading system. The game is structured with 4 times of the day, each with 5 levels (a Boss Fight in the 5th). Once you beat a Boss, you can't start from that point after you die, or you can go back to the beginning. This could have been fine, but it isn't.The upgrades are absolutely necessary. It's literally impossible to make any progress without upgrading everything. And that's usually how games go, but this is different. Your progress is 95% affected by your upgrades. There's no skill involved. It's a question of either having enough damage, or not having it. Even if you're a good player, you'll simply be overun by enemies that will rush you crystal. Once you die, there you go upgrade some more, and then beat it easily. And that's the whole game. The upgrades aren't at all interesting. They're just that, upgrades. More damage, more health, more speed, more money, more notes, etc.This makes for a very, very stale game. You're always doing the same thing! Running around, collecting gold so that you can buy more upgrades, until you reach the end. There are no deep mechanics to learn or master, no strategy, no anything. The only glimpse of strategy, is choosing your units. You'll unlock different units throughout the game, with different abilities. There's a huge problem with it, though. First off, some of them are pretty much useless. They're not helpful at all, so there's no point in even existing. The other problem, is unit upgrades. You can upgrade them too (see it as levels, basically. higher level=better version of the unit, simply that). BUT, if you want to test a unit, and see if they're any good, you'll have to upgrade them to the same level that your other units are. Otherwise, you can't compare them very well, can you? But, to upgrade them, you'll waste gold, that you only want to use in a unit that you know will be useful. And this is where the system falls apart. To try the unit, you'll have to waste gold already, otherwise, there's no point, as they'll be incredibly underpowered. This makes it a waste of gold (which equals to a waste of time, as your play time is simply to collect enough gold to make progress!). It's broken and pointless. This leads to a very limited cast of characters. I stuck around with most of the initial ones because of it. And I've done fine. Different characters could interact differently, but when the gameplay is literally just running around, it makes almost no difference! You don't play with the characters, they play themselves.To its credit, there are 2 other game modes. One is just survival, in which you get a random unit spawn that you must collect, and sometimes food (healing). There are bosses, from time to time, and the enemies will try to kill you (no crystal this time).The other one is an infinite runner mode, you a few stationary enemies (pretty much towers), and randomly spawned obstacles. Both of these modes unlock 2 cross-over characters, so you are encouraged to try them out.The achievements were... meh. Barely anything to encourage you different (and interesting) character combinations, which is a really big miss. They're mostly for beating each Boss, unlocking characters, upgrades, etc. Nothing interesting. And that's unfortunate.ConclusionThis game is literally a waste of time. You'll collect gold to buy upgrades and progress in the game. You'll not learn how to master the mechanics the more you play. You won't feel any kind of rewarding sensation whenever you beat a Boss.The game has potential, but ends up feeling like a lazy iOS game. You'll be entertained for 1-2 hours. Not more.",

        "text": "I'll start out by saying that I have a very limited experience with Turn Based games, and had absolutely no experience with Shadowrun before Shadowrun Returns. With that in mind, I may overlook lots of aspects that you find very important if you're more experienced than I am. Here are my thoughts nonetheless.The whole world of Shadowrun Returns sounded really interesting to me, as I like futuristic societies in general, and I don't think it's been done a whole lot in videogames, lately. And having heard good things about the game, I decided to give it a go.This is almost an RPG engine, in the world of Shadowrun. You'll have a short and very linear campaign, with a lot of dialogue, decent amount of combat, but not a lot of depth, mechanically. The depth is there, certainly, but I don't feel like it was explored at all with the main campaign. However, it comes with Steam Workshop and a level editor! Which means that user generated content will keep coming, and I have no doubt some talented people will manage to create much more interesting stories than the one told here, and even explore the mechanics far better.Let's talk about presentation.The graphics look awesome, in my opinion! And it's one of the aspects that pushed me to buy the game. Everything is hand-drawn and highly detailed. I made the mistake of not using AA (I don't know why) and the characters looked a bit too bad to me, but I later saw my mistake, and they actually look much better, and certainly fit with the scenery.In addition to the hand-drawn style, there are shadows and lightning, that complement it pretty well, and give it a more modern feel. It reminded me of a more modern Bastion, actually, which is always good. Not much to complain here, I'd say, it looks great!The music was pretty good as well! It changed seemlessly, and had a good futuristic, oppressive feel to it. Nothing groundbreaking, but I liked it.The interface was a bit clunky, probably because the game was on iOS as well. More clicks than it needed, and too few hotkeys.Regarding the main campaign, the story was good enough, in my opinion, but a bit too limited. It was very narrow, with no significant choices at all, and barely any sidequests. Besides being very linear, it was also much shorter than I expected, and left much to be desired. half of the game's mechanics were left on the side.It was mostly story-combat-story-combat-etc. Between each mission, you're sent into your Hub area, a bar, and you can buy new equipment there, buy spells, consumables, etc. And also learn more about the world and the characters by talking to them, and learning more about their purpose and role in Shadowrun. Before going into a mission, you also had the choice of choosing 2-3 partners to help you in battle, for a price. These had very varied classes to choose from, each with its uses, but overall, I didn't feel like I needed most of them. And some were really useless... didn't feel very well balanced. Its purpose was mainly to give you more freedom regarding your own character progression, by giving you a chance of having every skill that you needed. For that, I think it worked well.The combat was enjoyable, overall, but I don't think it was very unique. You had action points to spend with movement, skills and attacks, of which you gained more with time. It's turn based, with a cover system, and also a hit/miss chance. Which was what I found pretty bad, to be honest.It was everything but reliable, and it screwed me over more times than I felt like it should. It also helped me, but overall, it was not satisfying at all. This problem can be sort of avoided by using buffs regarding accuracy, but it still felt a bit cheap, at times. I would have liked the game to be harder, but more strategic and reliable. It's not like it only screwed me once or twice, it happened way too often. I didn't like the randomness of it, but overall, it was good. The characters' synergies were good, I liked that aspect regarding the combat.The inventory system was also a bit too limited. You could only manage it before each mission, without an opportunity of trading with other team members, or looting corpses. The rooms in the levels seemed fairly open, but there was very little to it, actually. Barely anything to collect, and not much backstory spread out. Another aspect that isn't very good, but can most likely be solved by the community!Now, with my biggest problem with the game. The character progression, classes, and the lack of information.Right from the beginning, you choose a few traits and a class, of which you know absolutely nothing about. You are free to choose whatever you want (including a classless option, if you know what you're doing), but it's also very easy to screw it up.The games does no effort at all in teaching you about each class, and how you should build one. You're simply thrown into the wolves, and have to deal with it the best way you can. I'll admit that my character was probably useless. I focused my attention in two things at once, one of which was pretty much useless, leaving the other one half assed. I can tell you that it didn't feel satisfying at all. There was also no respecialization that I've heard of, so I had to stick with it.There was also an aspect of choosing cybernetics, or magic, which was barely mentioned, and didn't feel in any way relevant.Equipment followed the same path, being very limited, and having almost no variation. No interesting side-grades, or anything.Consumables and drugs were also present in the game, but I had absolutely no need to use them, except for grenades (for AOE) and healing.And I was playing on Hard Mode. It was challenging at the beginning (due to bad character progression, and choosing the wrong support team mates), but it was overcome after a few hours, and experimenting with the different setups.Overall, I think the campaign was NOT well designed. At all. But the system is definitely there, waiting for the community to build upon!It did a really bad way of teaching the mechanics to the player, and an even worse job at taking advantage of them. But I feel like much better campaigns can be done with the engine, and I'll probably spend a lot more time browsing through the UGContent, and maybe even try my luck with it.If you're interesting in this game, I'd recommend it (probably on a sale), mostly for what it can be, not for what it is. The presentation is great, and despite being very flawed, it can all be solved with relative ease. I've heard even better things about the Dragonfall DLC, but I didn't feel like buying it yet, so it may all have been resolved already. Not great, but a solid game nonetheless! ",

        "text": "Paper Sorcerer is an old-school inspired dungeon-crawler RPG (In the same vein as Legend of Grimrock, although they're both very different games). As you can see from the screenshots, it has a very unique art-style that draws you in, and while it has a couple of good ideas and its head on its shoulders, it's falls very short of expectations once you go deeper into it.You're an evil sorcerer that was imprisioned in a book by the king. Once you're there, you'll gather allies and try to destroy the bindings of the book to free yourself. In essence, the game is mostly about combat. You go through several floors on a dungeon (there are 10 in total, each with a Boss in the end)  to free yourself. You can \"explore\" each floor, but exploration is very limited, and mostly just there to break the monotony of combat. There are also another 10 floors called the Catacombs, that serve more as a grinding place, and a SideQuest.Let's start with presentation.While the graphics' style is certain very unique, and I really liked it at the beginning, it barely every changes. Maybe a slighly different color scheme (between black/white and sepia), perhaps a different wall texture, but all in all, every floor looks very much alike, and it gets very repetitive later on, specially in a game that runs for about 15-20 hours.While in combat, you see the enemies' figure, but there's no animation in them. All you have is either particle effects for spells, or a simple swipe/throw animation for physical attacks. Personally, I don't mind the simplicity of it, but one big issue I had with it is that, despite being very simple, it took a long time.There's also a constant filter on the screen. To give it some texture. But it has no reason at all to be there. During the whole time, there's a translucid texture on your vision that makes no sense at all, and there's no option to disable it (unless it about turning the graphics down as a whole... only has Unity presets).Tangentially, the interface was sluggish as well. Everything took more clicks than it should, and the text boxes jumped to different places for no reason, leading to more time looking for the right place with the mouse.For example, with attacks in-combat: even if there only one enemy, is still has you selected the enemy you want to hit after choosing an attack. Unnecessary. If your character is either paralyzed or asleep, you only have one possible move. The game also has you have to select it anyway. Again, unnecessary.These are mere examples, but it happens a lot in this game. Its interface is certainly not good, and that really detracts from the experience in a game like this that's almost exclusively about inventory/party/skills management. Everything takes way too long to do, really disliked it.How's the music? Well, again, it missed its target. Sometimes the music felt like softer disco music. Some other times it felt more oldschool, other times more piano driven... very inconsistent. And for the most part, it didn't fit the game at all. And when the music is misplaced in a game, one tends to turn it off, right? Well, no sound options at all, so no deal. That's right. Either you mute the game, or you'll have to deal with it all. Not good at all...The sound effects weren't all that great, but they do the job, I don't mind those at all.It gets repetitive.The story was told through books you found by exploring the floors. But each \"book\" gives you a very small passage of the story, and they're spread apart pretty far. Meaning that you'll not really keep the story in mind, unless you want to read all of the books in succession from your inventory. I don't think it was a very good way to conveying it, but hey, you can ignore it easily without affecting the experience.Well, let's get on with what really matters in this game: the combat. Despite all the sweet coating, this game is all about combat and party management/equipping.First off, and this is common practice, you pick your difficulty out of 4 (Easy, Normal, Hard and 1980s) before starting the game and I believe it's permanent. You'll also pick your team mates as you go, but also very early on (in the first 2 or 3 floors, basically). They make you make all these choices without letting you know how each one plays out. It's a shot in the dark. There's no adaptation period, no \"extended\" tutorial to let you try out the different classes... It's a shot in the dark. And I don't agree with it at all. With the companions, they half overcome this problems. While you'll choose most of the members at the start, you'll have the ability of summoning others a few floors later, in the Catacombs. So, if you're not at all content with your party, you may be able to save the situation. But you may not. Each class has a short description, but it's not useful at all if you're not familiar with the mechanics, rendering it kinda pointless.You can have 3 parterns at once (plus yourself, the Sorcerer), and have others as a backup plan, and maybe switch them up if needed (outside of combat). I had absolutely no need to switch them, but the option is there.I played on Hard Mode. While it was actually really hard for the first 3 floors (and required grinding in the Catacombs), it then became far easier after I rearranged my team, and found a viable strategy. Unfortunately, it takes a few hours for you to do so.After the third Boss, while it's still fairly challenging, that difficulty almost came to a halt, as the same strategy worked for literally every battle. The game became far too monotonous. The enemies became mostly upgrades of the previous ones, which meant that I didn't need to change my party or tactics to succeed, unfortunately. The combat is typical RPG turn based. You have a basic attack, and you have skills. These skills can go from direct damage, damage over time, healing, improving X element of magic, increasing defense, control (like sleep, slow, paralyze) etc. It has lots of options, but it didn't seem to use them all very much.As I said, the combat is very slow. And to aggravate this problem, late in the game, you'll fight several enemies at once, and they all have tons of HP. You'll be constantly fighting the same enemies over and over again, and each fights takes a long time, even if you're out of danger.And I mean a LONG time. It got infuriating in the late game. At the half-way mark, about 10 hours in, I was enjoying it. I overcame my difficulties, and was solidifying my strategy. After that, it was just the same over and over and over again. Same enemies, same strategy.The mana system (Energy) in this game was quite cool. It was simplified, as you had far more limited amounts, but it would restore at a good rate, and you have to constantly managed how much a spell costs, or gives you, and try to keep constantly fighting. It really enjoyed this aspect!Let's talk about  encounters. Inconsistent, at best. It tries not to have random encounters, which is good! They place the enemies at certain points that you NEED to fight, but can prepare yourself. Great! Then, the catacombs have random encounters, and I saw it as a way to grind, if necessary. Even better! You only go there if you actually need to, so it's a good thing. But then, some of the main floors, seemingly at random, also have random encounters... It makes no sense to abandon previous design decisions for no reason! And it's infuriating to have random encounters appear out of nowhere! It destroys previously great design choices.The puzzles followed the same inconsistency. First, they were all self contained in each floor. Great! Then, they start spreading through several floors with no previous indication...Paper Sorcerer could have been pretty good. But it's not consistent with its design, and gets too repetitive. Huge miss, sorry to say... ",

        "text": "PixelJunk Shooter is a twin-stick shooter, with a very big focus on physics (specifically fluids). While exploring the underground caves of a planet, you'll have to interact with lava, water, liquid metal, ice and rock in order to save the scientists who are now trapped.The story is basically that. You're in a ship, trying to save every scientist. And also collecting hidden gems. Whole it may seem a game about exploration, it didn't quite get to that point, in my opinion. But more on that later.Let's start with presentation.The graphics' style is very minimalistic, with soft colours, and yet, it looks great, in my opinion. It certainly looks unique, and the fluids especially, give it a a special look.The enemies have a mechanical feel to them, but it fits, along with the Boss Fights. The music was less of a standout for me, but it was certainly not bad. Just a bit more faint than I'm used to, staying in the background for the most part. It helped with the light-hearted exploration-y atmosphere, I think it was well chosen for the game they were going for.The sound effects were in the same vein.How's the gameplay, then?First off, the game is divided into 3 areas, each with a few levels. Each level also has about 4 (I think) areas to explore, each of them self contained, and fairly small.The first area is more vulcanic, the second, deeper, is full of ice, and the third, the deepest, has an industrial feel to it.Each of them has different mechanics associated with the physics. These are all connected to the area it's set in.You control a little space ship, propelled by thrusters. The movement feels quite great actually, with momentum very notable in the ships handling. It feels great, even though there aren't section to challenge your pilloting skills. It's still good that the tight control is there while you're just flying around.Then, you have a Hook/Tractor thing to pick up the gems and the scientists you find, and you also have missiles, to destroy rocks and your enemies.There are also several different types of ships. You'll find modifiers in specific points of the levels. For the standard ship, lava with overheat you, while water will cool you off. Each time you get hit, you don't instantly die, but your heat will rise substancially. To survive, you can either back away, or dive into water.Besides, you'll find ship modifiers around the levels, for when you need to actually progress the levels.There is a Magma ship, that shoots lava, a Water ship that shoots water, and can pull ice with is hook, there's an inverted ship, that is hurt by water, and can dive on lava, and there's also a Magnetic ship that repels the liquid metal. These sound, and play really well, but they're highly limited to the levels. You'll only have access to them in the exact section that you need them, and there's no action from the player in discerning which ship he needs for the given section, unfortunately.In each level, you'll try to find the scientists. You have to deal with all of them in each area to unlock the next one (either save them, or kill them). Every time a scientist dies, you'll lose a life. Your limit is 5, but you'll gain another one each time you collect 100 coins (these are spread around the levels, and also dropped by the enemies).You also try to find gems, that are used to unlock levels, or just for achievements. Unfortunately, these are very easy to miss by mistake, and you'll have to replay the whole level if you want to 100% it (it is NOT needed, though. I did some thorough exploration the first time around, found every secret area, and still missed a couple of gems in many of the levels. I never had the need to replay levels to proceed though, so the game was designed to keep you going naturally, saving these for the completionists. That's really good, in my view!).There are also Special Scientists that you collect in your Gallery (yeah, not creepy at all), and these will talk to you, giving you a bit of backstory into their expedition.The base of the game is out of the way, now.This game reminded my a bit of Waking Mars. Besides both being about exploring the caves, both are very focused about combining elements (in WM, it's mostly interacting with the creatures, in PJShooter, is with the fluids). While Waking Mars gave you a real feeling of discovery, learning about each species and all about their lives and interactions, that isn't very present in PixelJunk Shooter.PixelJunk Shooter is a very straightforward game, and also not very challenging. It's something to enjoy casually.The level design was pretty good, in my opinion, providing good areas to experiment with the fluids, and learn new mechanics without a wall of text. While that was all there and great, the whole game felt like a very big tutorial, in a way. Everything was subtle, but not challenging, and specially not giving the player much freedom.You'll have everything delivered into your hands when you need it, there's no puzzle solving, or anything, which wasn't what I was expecting. So, if you're looking for an experience of discovery and learning, go play Waking Mars.If, on the other hand, you want a laid back twin stick shooter with cool physics, give this one a try.The Boss Fights were the funnest part of the game, for me. They weren't very hard either, as you were pretty comfortable even after getting hit (as long as you were careful). But that comfort gave you the time to learn the Bosses patterns without it feeling frustrating, and led to interesting fights.I found the game enjoyable, certainly, but in a way that I wasn't expecting. It's very, very linear. There isn't trial and error to understand the fluids, or anything. It's not about learning the mechanics, and then applying them into more complex puzzles. It's mostly about learning on the go, always with simple puzzles. And to be honest... that's fine. It may not be what you're looking for, but it's good that it exists, for people who do. And it's a very well done game for its purpose.It's also very cheap on sale and you can easily get it. Go ahead and give this one a try if it sounds appealing!",

        "text": "Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers is a unique game, that takes a fairly familiar concept, and takes it to a whole new level.The jist of the game is that you can cut almost everything is a level with your laser, and then pull it with a hook, or push it with a rocket. Simple enough, heh? Well, it works really well! Each level is fairly large, and everything is huge, when compared to the size of your character. Then, it's about discovery and exploration, which this game certainly encourages! The story is a bit silly, but if you look past it, it will reveal a deeper story of power and civilization. It's put very simply, and it's clearly not something you should obcess over, but it's nice that it's there, and it adds a bit of depth to an otherwise very silly game! (Don't worry, it's still very silly as it is!)You play as Tiny, and you're off to collect the only thing your late Grandpa has left you: a pair of pants. Why pants? Hell if you know. But it's the last thing he has collected, as a spelunker, so it should be worth it.And you're off, into a very empty desert. Then you have an accident, and you'll soon discover a new world in that seemingly empty desert. It's you and your radio on a mighty quest! For... pants.Presentation wise, the game is simple, but it has its own style. I reminded me a bit of Psychonauts, which I know is a plus for many people.  Everything seems hand-drawn (even the textures). Everything seems rough, but it fits the whole style of the game, in my opinion. Then, each time something falls, it'll make a noise, and will also drop a big \"BAMM\" or... \"SMURTLES\", in addition to the sound effect. It's nice, it's a cool little detail.Another cool aspect I really enjoyed, was the little hints present in the world regarding its civilization and its lore. It goes a long way into making a world very enjoyable to explore, and feel lively rather than empty. There are also secret levels that place you inside an old gameboy, with graphics to match. Only in 3D!Overall, everything has a very unique feel to it, it's pretty good.The music was also really good! It's hard to classify it, but it fits the barren wasteland where you are. Since you're on a journey with your radio, the music isn't necessarily continuous. You're free to switch tracks around with a single key, and just listen to the tracks you want. I usually prefer the music to be tailored to the situations, but as the sandbox game that this is (mostly), I think that it works better in this way.Along with it, sound design is also very good.  Since you're mostly cutting huge stones, everything will soon start to break, with a big impact. Both the sound effects and a small screen shake will give you the impression that the world is literally falling apart around you. I may or may not have tried to dodge rocks myself from my comfortable chair. Immersion is a strongpoint in this game!Now, how is gameplay?Well, it's the shining point of Tiny and Big!As I said, the mechanics are very simple. You have a laser, with which you cut the environment. You have what it essentially a grappling hook, to pull objects towards you. And you have a rocket, that you attach to things, and send them flying.And with these 3 bad boys, you can do anything, really. There are 6 levels (one of which is a Boss Fights) only, but you can easily sink at least one hour into each, in your first palythrough (and you're likely to miss secrets, which are worthy going back for).The scale of the game is awesome, with very open areas, generally, and lots of places to reach. Of course, you can't just climb stairs... if you want, you'll have to make them. You'll cut pillars, mountains, doors, ... you name it. Chances are, if you can see it, you can reach it! Somehow.Finishing the level isn't really the point here. Than can be done very quickly, and very easily. And all things considered, it won't be worth it. But, the game has a bunch of secrets areas to explore, and a few collectibles, if you're in for achievements. There are also or challenges, if you want to limit your toolkit. If you're into more sandbox-y and exploration games, definitely give this one a try!You'll find yourself trying to climb everything, cut the world in two (or, you know... in 50), looking under every rock (well, mountain)... you get the drill. One very good thing, is that the game never really punishes exploration, at all! Once you reach somewhere important, the game will auto-save. That way, even if you die, you can just get back to it. It's a very good thing!There are God figures to find, rocks to collect (just for the achievements, generally, and also encouraging exploration even more), there are Music Tapes, to add to your collection and there are also Arcades! Each arcade is essentially a \"challenge\" level. Some of them were very easy and straightforward, others were slightly more challenging. It's just a nice addition to the game. There are also Easter Eggs spread around the world. The room where the band made the game's music, for example, with posters referencing other games, and the such. These are certainly nice to find.The achievements, weirdly enough, are also a good thing, in this case. The developers knew that the game was all about exploration, trying different strategies, challenging yourself, and as such, they've implemented achievements accordingly. All of them were made to encourage you to explore, rather than just try to finish it. And it's a good thing, it's nice to see it for a change!One issue that I have with the game, is the dialogue. Not because it's bad, but because of the way it was presented. In the cutscenes, everything was fine, and it made me grin a little. During gameplay, however, it has a big problem. In order not to obstruct the player's vision, they've kept the dialogue in the corners. The problem with it, is that you're very, very likely to miss it, amidst the chaos. The whole world is falling on you, so it's understandable you'll miss the little dialogue in your peripheral vision. It's not a deal breaker, at all, but it's still a flaw, I'd say.Another thing, is that the game is quite short, if you're into repeating levels, which I can understand. 5 levels is a bit short (I'm not counting the Boss Fight), even if they are varied. I've spend from 40 minutes to 1 hour in each level, roughly, by trying to explore as much as possible. I still missed a couple of things, which I'm likely to go back to, but you may not be.But, all things considered, Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers is a genuinely great game! I hadn't felt as immersed in a game as I have with it, in a while, and that's all due to the freedom it gives you. It's like a puzzle-platformer, without the genre's main flaw, for most people, which is that the solution are somewhat limited. Some people don't like those kinds of games, simply because there are very limited solutions to those problem. Well, that's not the case with this game. There are countless ways of traversing the map, all equally fun and valid!You'll just lose yourself in each level, experimenting with each rock, cutting and pulling, trying to reach something that looks interesting.Give this one a try, it's definitely worth your time!",

        "text": "Journey of a Roach is the second Cockroach-themed game I've played in the last 3 weeks. What's happening to the games industry right now?Journey of a Roach is a short adventure game (see it like a point n' click game, but with actual freedom of movement) set in a post apocalyptic world governed by radiation worshipping ants. Yeah, sounds believable!The premise is very simple, but quite charming as well. Your one cockroach friend finds a flower in the middle of the barren wasteland the world has become. And he's quite enamored with it, and runs to tell you... But, unfortunately, he falls underground, and is later impriosed by the Ants.And there your journey starts, finding your way into their base to rescue your friend, and finally see the beautiful flower.The presentation of this game was very well done! It's certainly very light-hearted, and even... childish, but in a good way. The only voice-acting is gibberish (in a pretty frantic way, which was funny), and the characters' thoughts is told through pictures and some comic-book like cutscenes.The cartoony art-style is nothing to write home about, but it fits the theme, and it looked good enough. The music was also good in relation to the theme, and the overall vibe of the game, but it's nothing I'd listen to outside of it.The sound design was pretty good, although I could see the voice acting being annoying for some people. I enjoyed it, even with gibberish, they managed to get the point across, and the tonality always fit the character's mood.In this case, I'd say the whole is better than the sum of its parts! Nothing particularly spectacular, but it all works towards the same goal, and it ends up working out.  How's gameplay, then?Well, you work your way down, solving a set of puzzles in each floor. You go around collecting items, and trying to combine them until something works. The solutions are usually pretty over the top, and they make sense only after the fact, which can be a bummer. On the other hand, each area is small enough that you won't be backtracking a lot to experiment with stuff, and everything can easily be solved without feeling too frustrating.One aspect that I hate about point n' click games (which is pretty much the go-to genre for adventure games) is that movement is very limited, and lacks control, is sluggish, etc.This game eliminates that, having you walking with WASD, which I found really good. It may seem a little thing, but it makes a significant difference to me.The problem with the movement, is that, well... you're a cockroach, and so you can crawl on walls and the ceiling. Which results in the world constantly moving around, which gave me some serious motion sickness. And this was probably my main problem with the game, everytime I played it, I felt sick, and so I tried to get done with it as soon as possible (not bothering with completing it after finishing the main story).So, if you have any problems with Motion Sickness in video games... probably pass this one up. Disregard if you think you're fine with it. So. You go to the several rooms of each floor, and try to solve the characters' problems, in a step towards finding your friend.The solutions are all pretty silly, usually leading to a chain of reactions that will be amusing, but certainly not very predictable (which is a minus in the puzzling, but again, it's not a major problem).You'll try to dress up like a radiation-worshipping ant, you'll help a Spider with her baby flies, and you'll launch a nuclear rocket. What could go wrong in this game?!It's a very simple game, and can easily be finished in 2-3 hours in your first playthrough. The story is amusing, it'll make you smile at times, and it's something good not to worry about. If you're interested, get this, enjoy it, and then be done with it. There are also \"secrets\" to reward exploration, and some optional actions for achievement. I haven't bothered with it simply due to motion sickness, but it's good that's it's there!I like Journey of a Roach for what it was. Nothing groundbreaking, but certainly a charming little adventure game.P.S.: There was a sections in which they tried to give the game some sort of challenge (?), in which you had to walk through a vent, with blazing \"fans\" that would get you back to the beginning of the section. However, the perspective was a bit off, and it just felt pointless and out of place. You could easily just not see the fan correctly and get killed. But it was also very short, and once you passed a fan, you could deactivated, so it wasn't frustrating or anything, because of that decision, which was a good call. But still, I have no idea why it was there, it wasn't very good, it was also very short, and overall out of place, with poor perspective. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the game, but it was a design decision that I just didn't understand, so I'll leave it here.",

        "text": "Pid is a 2.5D platformer, standing between hardcore and puzzle approaches to its design.It certainly stands from the crowd for how beautiful it looks, with a colorful and joyful visual style, but left me a bit skeptical in its gameplay.I had my eye on this game for a while. After playing Shelter (Might & Delight's other game), I was interested in what else they had done, as Shelter is certainly a unique game! Pid seemed more traditional, but hey, why not give it a go?You play as Kurt, a kid lost in a totally unknown planet, after oversleeping in the bus. This new world draws the player in with its visuals and, well... peculiar characters. It certainly creates a wonderful world, and that was the main factor that kept me going.You visit several different places, slowly learning more about the planet and the crisis it's going through, while trying to get back to your home.All you know is that traffic and communication to the outside has suddenly stopped, leading you to help with its problems so that you can get back.The story wasn't its main focus, but it was certainly well done, and fairly interesting.And to be honest, it wasn't the actual plot I cared about, but the setting, and the people living there. And Pid certainly did the trick for me.Let's talk about its presentation.The game looks pretty incredible. Everything is very clean and smooth and has a characteristic look to it. Every person/creature looks like a puppet of sorts, and I think it contributes positively to its vibe. Its simplicity is its great strength. Also, the areas you visit look significantly different, with detailed backgrounds to draw your attention (whenever you don't have to worry about dying).Despite all the enemies in the game, it doesn't feel hostile, and it reminds me of certain games of my childhood, which is good.The music was also one of its highest points for me. Retro Family did an incredible job with it, maintaining the feel of old-school games, with a more jazz-y feel to it. Again, fairly simple, but it sounded really great, and went along with the game perfectly. It's actually something I'll be listening to outside of the game, it's pretty great!They also managed to keep it on par with the different areas, making some things more classical, or eerie, others more fast paced... I liked it a whole lot.So, let's about gameplay, shall we?This... is what left me very uncertain about the game. On one hand, I wanted to fully recommend it, but it's not nearly as well designed as I had hoped.The main mechanic is a beam of light, which alters gravity. It's a simple, yet effective mechanic. Throughout the game, you'll unlock many different items to go along with it. Some of them seemed pretty useless, however. Other were fine, but none particularly interesting that I remember. Still, it kept the gameplay varied enough not to get too boring, and it led to many different ways of approaching each problem.With this mechanic, it's obvious the it could go both ways: being a puzzler, or a hardcore platformer. It ended up doing both, but these two just felt thrown in together, with no sense of pacing, in my opinion. You'll also collect Stars to buy more items (if you don't find enough in the environment), and there are Special Constellations as well as Souvenirs, that are hidden, and work for achievement hunters, and just exploring in general. The game starts out great! Smaller rooms (with good maneuvering space, but not overwhelming, and good recovery time), with good checkpoint placement.I started out taking the time to get these secrets, and despite being challenging, it didn't feel frustrating. You would get back in the action quickly enough. I was having fun!Then, the game started to show far bigger areas, with very sparse checkpoints. And I've found myself trying to collect these secrets, and dying afterwards. And I had to do everything over again, which started to get infuriating. Besides, these checkpoints aren't reactivatable, which means that even if you get back to the supposed checkpoint, it's pointless. With the smaller rooms, this system worked fine, but as soon as it opens up, it all falls apart. You'll have to thread the same territory over and over again... the game simply doesn't respect the player's time in these circumstances.There is also a fair amount of vertical paltforming, which won't kill you for mistakes, but it'll throw you all the way down, resulting in even more time where you're not actually having fun. And this is probably my main problem with the game, and the reason why I stopped trying to go for the collectibles at one point. It was simply not worth it.While trying to be an hardcore platformer, it went against the games' foundations, and resulted in a frustrating experience, unfortunately.I don't mind hard games, but I hate games that thrive in trial and error, and repetition due to lack of checkpoints. One simply change would be letting the player keep the stars after he died, or just save whenever the player reached those secrets. It would have made things so different... but it doesn't, and it feels badly designed, in my opinion.Other than that, it's a pretty good game! If you focus more on progressing itself, and try to get into the world and the story, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. Maybe go for the collectibles in a second playthrough.The game has 4 Boss Fights (if I remember correctly), and each fight feels very different from each other, as well as each Boss. Each of them looks unique, and has its own very simple, yet recognizable personality. And they're also a good challenge! Several patterns to memorize, but you'll surely ace it after a few deaths. I enjoyed these quite a lot!Now, each stage is mostly about getting to the ending without getting killed, more in the style of a hardcore platformer than a puzzle. I say this because its focus was in execution rather than identifying the solution. Even after knowing what to do, you're likely to die several times, sometimes due to a bit unpredictable enemy behaviour.Still, as I said, there are several ways of completing each area, and while a bit hard, they're accessible, as long as you don't try to collect every Star, which gets infuriating fairly quickly. At least it did for me.Now, one big flaw, it the lack of pacing. Instead of spacing out the hard sections with a couple of puzzles in the middle, Pid just seems to have no specific order in which to throw ou problems. And it keeps getting worse, unfortunately. I think it would have benefitted from being more intervaled. Do a hard section, and then give the player a break. Let him look at the world, solve a couple of puzzles, relax. Then throw another hard sections. And then rinse and repeat.There were two moments where it had short periods of calm (after the storm) and they both felt great! On of them was the farmlands. After going through a lot, you reached a very green and lively place, that was pretty striaghtforward, without challenge for 2 minutes. Just that. Look at the houses and the trees, appreciate the world. They you're on your own.Another moment was right after the first Boss. He summoned a few creatures that felt quite hostile, with the music, the Boss and everything else. Yet, after the Boss was defeated, only one of these was alive, and there was no music. And it was at that moment that you could just look at it, listening to the noises the creature done by jumping, and realized how simple and easy it was, without all the chaos of the Boss fight. I'm not sure this was intentional, but it was certainly something that amused me!Some moments in Pid made me smile at how some simple things worked so well. The rest was a bit too frustrating, unfortunately. It seemed to punish exploration, rather than encouraging it. Don't do that...But despite its flaws, it's a good game!",

        "text": "Spate is a weird game. Far more on the side of an artistic experience, more atmospheric and narrative driven, rather than a game with solid mechanics that you need to learn in order to overcome various obstacles.This by itself might put a lot of people off, as the game bundles itself with Dear Esther, Gone Home, Limbo, Braid, etc.I would definitely not pair it with Limbo and Braid. Those games had more focus on the mechanics, regardless of having just as big of an artistic approach to it.But, I certainly enjoyed Spate. I wouldn't consider it as good as most other attempts at art-sy games, but it certainly had a few great moments!In Spate, you're an alcoholic father, who has \"lost\" his little girl. You're in a twisted, dream-like land (it reminded me quite a lot of Alice Madness Returns, in a good way) in search for answers.You, and your absynthe. And because of that, you don't know what is real, and what is not. You don't know what's actually true, or what you've hallucinated in this weird world. And that's part of its charm.Visually, the game is beautiful, without a lot of strange creatures, and a world that makes you feel tiny and insignificant right from the beginning. The game is also very heavy on effects, and camera movements, so beware if you get motion sickness easily. All in all, I really like the look of the game, and trying to figure out exactly where the hell I was.A big issue, is that it performs terribly. The developer is actively trying to make it better, but it still runs pretty badly, even in very good rigs. I played at probably 30-45 fps and it didn't really impact the gameplay too much, but a smoother experience would be much better.The music was actually phenomenal! It was one of the high points for me. It has a sad feel to it, and very heavy, actually (Not in a heavy metal way, but created a very heavy atmosphere), and it was beautiful. It was fairly minimalistic, but it worked perfectly.I'm not sure if it was influenced by the players actions, but it always hit the spot for me, with its intensity. I'm very impressed with both graphic and sound design in this game, both beautifully crafted!Now, how was gameplay?Well, pretty weak, for the most part.It seemed more of a vehicle for the narrative, but just ended up feeling a bit too empty in that regard.You jump and run to the right, for the most part, with some soft platforming. A few saws here and there, some somewhat precise platforming, but there was hardly any challenge. As there shouldn't be, taken how the game was designed. It's more of a walk, enjoying the world and its looks, trying to answer the questions it brings.There were also 2 sequences where you were in a flying boat, that played a bit like flappy bird (with good maneuvering space, not unfair or anything) to keep the game fresh, but it felt out of place, and a very artificial way to keep things interesting.Then, there was the main mechanic, directly tied to the narrative. You can take a sip at your absynthe. That'll make the world even more surreal, making you dazy, but will also make you run faster and jump higher (perhaps a bit how you would feel, like it's a weight off your back, ready to face the world).You could easily beat the game without drinking anything. But you could also drink a lot, like the drunk you are!And, while they may not matter in what the game does later on, it serves as your own story. In this case, the path, and not the final goal. There were a couple of great moments where I myself felt inclined to drink (or not to), as my own interpretation of what was happening, and that's also something I didn't expect, but was very cool.The whole game is narrated by you (the character), about how things got where they are. About all that went wrong. About losing your daughter, your wife, and now your life, to the alcohol.It's up to your whether or not you try not to drink, or just drink to forget. While great in concept, it didn't quite feel as significant as it could have been, as it changes nothing, in the end (And I don't think that was the point, although it could certainly be a valid interpretation).The game has 2 endings, I believe, but they're not based on your actions , it's more of a binary choice in the last sequence of the game. And that was very disappointing. I feel that much more could have been done with the theme. I liked the narrative of the game, I've found it fairly enjoyable, and has you questioning reality, life, misery, all within a very surreal looking world. The gameplay, on the other hand, isn't as tied to it as it should. But hey, it's not too bad.The game is pretty short (most people finish it in 90minutes to 2 hours) for one playthrough, and the binary nature of the choice lacks replayability.Despite thinking the game has still a huge room for improvement, I still liked it, for what it is. It's a beautiful walk in the park, structured more as a short film than as a game, but still worth trying out if you're into these kinds of games.Wait for a sale if you think it's too short for 10$, but it's certainly an interesting one.",

        "text": "Sequence is a Hybrid of a Rhythm game and an RPG. Every combat is done in the way of a rhythm game like, say, Guitar Hero. With each battle you gain experience, materials and equipment, which you can all use to become more powerful, and face harder enemies, progressing through the story.That may or may not seem like it works for you, but trust me, they've done a damn fine job with it!You're Ky, and you wake up in a Tower, with amnesia. Everything inside feels like a weird game in which you're but a pawn. You life is in danger, or so you're told, and so you fight for survival, learning about the place and its purposes on the way.While the story did feel a bit cheesy for the most part, it did have a few cool ideas, and a few twists to keep it interesting. It's not the main focus on the game, but I think it added quite a lot of character to it. There's not much in way of graphic style in this one. The graphics consist mainly of hand drawn backgrounds and characters, with a bit of animation when they talk. It's not bad, by any means, just not something that you'll play this game for.Even during the battles, each spell you cast (more on that later) only produces a few sparkles as visual effects, but it's just enough not to feel empty. All in all, it's very simple, and let's you focus on the gameplay, while maintaining an appealing look. The only criticism I have of it is that certain spells will overload the screen with particles, obstructing necessary information.Another thing, regarding the interface. Outside of battle it's nothing special, but it's certainly easy to navigate. But when in-battle, it gives you every bit of information necessary without having to look for it too hard. And this is a great since, since this game WILL challenge your multi-tasking abilities (in a good way!).Good job on that! Keeping it simple, yet complete.I would now talk about the music, but music and gameplay are directly tied in Sequence. So I'll try to summarize gameplay and then talk about its strengths and weaknesses.As I said before, you're in a Tower. You're guided by Naia, who gives you recipes as you go along.You go from floor to floor, with a Boss Fight in the end of each.When you enter a floor, you'll be given recipes for Equipment, Spells, and a Key and Inhibitor for that floor. There are 3 enemies in each, which drop 3 different materials, for you to craft later. When you craft the key, you're able to unlock the door to the next floor, and fight the Guardian.Your characters has Mana (to cast spells), Health, Defense (to lower the damage you take), and Offense (to increase the damage you deal through spells).You can improve these either by leveling up, or by wearing different pieces of equipment. Equipment is mainly linear in its progression, without many sidegrades. Trinkets, on the other hand, are a bit different. These can improve your spells' cost, their cooldown, make battles harder to improve item drops, etc. These are actually more tailored for different types of gameplay, and some have pretty cool effects.Some you get by crafting, others you can get by enemy drops.The Inhibitor is used to lower the Guardians' effects (more on that later).Then, there are spells. You can craft them, and then have to learn them. How do you learn them? You play a certain track on the game, with an added challenge (which can be a note streak, or a given accuracy). These are carefuly designed, as they would be in Guitar Hero, with different button presses following the notes' pattern (to an extent, of course).They weren't too hard, mostly. But the final one was way more challenging, but also very fun to play, so I won't complain.This pretty much it for when you're outside the battles.How are the battles, then?Well, there will be arrows falling, to the beat, and you'll have to press them. Pretty simple. But that's not all, of course.(There are single notes, or doubles. For these, you have 2 sets of \"arrows\" on the controller/keyboard, to make it easier, specially on a controller. It works really well, and you'll find yourself a master of it by the end, and it feels great! The game does a very good way to constantly challenge you, making you better, without being frustrating.)In every battle, you have 3 screens you need to pay attention to. One, is your Defense screen. Each arrow you miss here will damage you, so you need to keep an eye on it.Another one is your Mana screen. This one has the same spell learning pattern, making it the closest to the song, with a lot more notes. Each failed note doesn't penalize you, but you gain one Mana for each note you strike, which is needed to cast spells.Finally, you have your Spell screen. You have a spell wheel, with your different spells (you have a limited number that you choose outside the battles). Each has a different effect and costs more/less mana, with a bigger/lesser cooldown.Each time you activate a spell, its notes will start dropping. The spell is cast if you strike them all. If you fail a single on, bye bye mana.That's it, mostly. Your objective is to lower your opponent's life before he does yours. Every piece of information (damage dealt, received, mana, etc.) is easily visible to you, which is great.You will be constantly switching between these 3 screens during the battles, which sometimes gets a bit chaotic at later stages, but never too bad. The whole game is a constant balance between when you can afford to take damage, when you need mana, and so on, rarely feeling stale!With each enemy is a song associated, so you'll repeat some on them quite a lot for their items/experience, but it's not too grindy.One more important aspect is the Guardians! Each one has a special ability, that'll mess you up, during their fight, and the fights in their floor. These can go from obstructing your different screens (so that you need to be there to see what's happening) to accelerating the tempo of the songs, or the last one, that switches the arrows. This one was diabolical. Everything you had learned goes to hell, and you need to play everything in reverse. But it doesn't last long, so it's all good. It's these differences that keep some of the battles very interesting, and you never know when it might throw you off of your comfort zone! The music was done by DJPlaeskool and Ronald Jenkees. It's a mix of electronic/synth music, with a bit of rock. It's wasn't something I was into at the start of the game, but it started growing on me. I ended up enjoying the music quite a bit, although I won't listen to most of it outside the game. Although, the last song, and so freaking epic... Man, I wasn't expecting that. That song had changes in tempo that worked great musically and from a gameplay standpoint! (It's called Piano Jam, search it on youtube). That one I'll be listening to for a while. Great job!So, I enjoyed the music, but I do believe it lacks a bit in replayability comparatively with other rhythm games. But it's also a very unique and very well designed game. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected, and it had many brilliant design choices. There isn't much negative to say about it, really, aside from having to grind a bit, and perhaps looking a bit too simple. But even that didn't really lower the experience much for me.I really enjoyed Sequence, and I think it does a great job of mixing the rhythmic combat and RPG elements.One thing though, is that during the battles, while the notes do fall on the beat, there isn't as big of a connection to the notes and there is on the Mana screen (or the spell learning). Each spell has a pattern (with some random elements) that is independent of the song, and the enemies as well. So, it might not feel like like you're playing the music.But I don't think it detracts from it too much, and those modes are still present.Sequence is surprisingly great! ",

        "text": "RADical ROACH is an horizontal  shoot 'em up game that stands neither on the bullet-hell side, nor on the more traditional Gradius-like type of shooter.You're a mute cockroach in a post apocalyptic world, apparently dominated by fleas (and other insects and creatures), all trying to put a stop to your renegade run.It's your job to keep going forward, through 4 different areas, each with a certain theme and enemies.First off: the developers warned the players that the game is hard. Well... it certainly is, but not for the right reasons at all. It's not a good challenge. It challenges your persistence and patience rather than your skill and reflexes. I'll talk more about level design and difficulty later on.Alright, let's begin with its presentation, as usual. As you can probably see from the screenshots, the game looks pretty good!It has a bold, hand drawn, cartoony style, and to be honest, it fits the silliness of the game's story.Everything has a personal look to it, and the bosses are also interesting, in their visual design. It feels like it was made in Flash, and that's fine. The problem is that it plays like it was made by an illustrator with very limited knowledge of how to design the game (other than its visual style).The animations can be dodgy, at times, without solid transitions between each other. Specially for the bigger enemies, they just vanish into a far smaller explosion sprite when they die, which looks a bit awkward.All in all, every animation seems to have fewer frames than it should, not really feeling fluid enough. But hey, it's not too bad, it just could have been more polished.This is a side scrolling shooter, so expect a heavy amount of parallaxing with quite a few layers, that actually looks pretty cool. Despite being a fairly simplistic way of doing it, I actually liked the way the backgrounds passed through, well done on that! A problem with it, was that you could see the repetition on it, if you look close enough. Slightly larger backgrounds wouldn't have been bad, but it's just a minor concern.How about sound effects and music?Well, both felt off, to be honest. They didn't really fit the theme.. The music itself wasn't bad, but again, it just felt generic, and didn't complement the game's visual style in any way.One big problem I've had with sound design, was that the music just restarted whenever you died. Instead of just continually play, keeping the flow of the game up, it stopped, and started from the beginning. Maybe this isn't very obvious for most people, but it actually makes a huge difference when playing a game, specially one that requires multiple tries and restarts.Just another criticism, that isn't quite directed at the game, but I'll just leave as a future suggestion.There were times when enemies threw projectiles at a rhythm, which helped me get more \"immersed\" into those sequences and felt great. The problem is that it wasn't sync'ed with the music, and ended up ruining the moment. I realize it was most likely not the intention, but I think the game would have benefitted from more rhythm oriented sections.Another very annoying thing, was the lack of options. It didn't even have music/sound effects toggles. It was just piss poor.Sometimes, I like to just put on my own music, and that wasn't an option at all. Even for lowering sound, I had to use the Windows' Sound Mixer. Big no on this. Come on, how hard is it to put a couple of separate sliders into the game?It had \"Fullscreen\" and \"HD Mode\"(Whatever that was) and another 2 other options that I didn't really need.Oh... and it doesn't have a Pause Button. If you press escape, you're taken to the level select screen, which will, of course, start you from the beginning of the level. And, if that level happens to have a cutscene, you'll have to see it again, since they're all unskippable. The menus were just awful from a navigation standpoint, without consistency at all, sometimes using Esc, other time having to click it, ... It was awful. And it makes a more negative impact on the game that could have easily been avoided.Let's get on with gameplay.This... is going to be hard. It's mostly awful... with a few glimpes at good ideas, and a couple of good levels.Your objective is to survive for X amount of time in each level, essentially. There will be different phases in each level. While the phases are fixed, enemy movement within those is a bit random. Radical Roach implements what's known as \"quantity over quality\". In almost every single level, there is a huge amount of enemies, cornering you into a place where you'll definitely take damage. The most effective way of playing it is actually just shooting straight and not movement, for the most part. Another huge problem, is the hitboxes. Specially the player's. It really big. It's not like a bullethell, where they let you dodge bullets efficiently. No, no, no, no, no! Not here. Here, you'll just have to find the sweet spot, and stand there for as long as possible. And pray that the game doesn't spawn enemies in places that will be impossible to dodge. The game is pretty straightforward, and there isn't much innovation here. There are a couple of cool enemy designs, with patterns that you must learn (and I really like that sort of design!), but then, they're just mixed with the awful amount of other enemies spawning randomly, and leaves the player really frustrated.Another impediment, is the way the parallaxing has foreground layers, with obstruct the vision, and some of the enemy projectiles get easily mixed with the background colors, rendering the screen a freaking mess. The difficulty in this game comes from bad level design, exclusively. Big hit boxes, some awkward collision detection at times, too much flash, bad choice of colors, etc. etc.And almost every level is like that, unfortunately.In the first world, the screen was fairly big, giving the player space to maneuvre (except for the amount of enemies on there...). But in the second world, you're on a cave, that highly limits where you can go...! Most of it makes no sense. It's just a bunch of ideas thrown together, without the concept of pacing. There is no difficulty curve at all. The game starts and ends at roughly the same difficulty. (Well, the last levels were actually easier).You also have a shield and a special projectile (first it's a laser beam, then a triple shot, a black hole, etc., changing with each world). The problem is that the game strips you off of it at will. In some levels they're available, in other levels it's not...Then, the shield is badly implemented. It pops whenever you touch a spike (which occurs awfully frequently, as your hitbox gets bigger with the shield), and it also has like a second of delay... So, if you're in a pinch, you're dead. It's not like you can use the shield at the right moment... BUT, there was hope! The Bosses were actually quite fun, at times (despite creating a few almost impossible dodges at times), and there were a few levels that were far more structured, and thus, less frustating. The penultimate level was a good example of that. It was tricky, certainly. But you could plan ahead, and then avoid everything with skill and reflexes, rather than luck.Unfortunately, those good moments were few and far between.It had potential. But it's the perfect example of artificial difficulty. It's not that people don't like hard games, it's that hard games nowadays do it wrong. They're about randomness and trial and error!I forced myself to complete every level, just to see if it went somewhere. By the end, it's slightly more interesting than it the beginning, but it's not enough. It constantly tested my patience, with barely any reward. Finishing a level felt more like relief than pride... And when that happens, you're doing something bad.Stay away...",

        "text": "Wow. Just wow. This game... was certainly not at all what I expected. Taken its development history, and the whole Phil Fish drama and subsequent backlash, I had this game in the back of my mind, labelled as a simple indie platformer. Still, I wouldn't lose anything for playing it. And I went for it, expecting a pretty platformer.Several days later, I found myself in a room... papers on the floor, with weird symbols and ciphers on them. Well, maybe I'm embellishing the story a little bit, but that was the feeling I got from it. And it felt damn good.Alright. Fez is NOT your traditional game. It's not as much of a platformer as it is a puzzle game. And also not a typical puzzle game. Its final puzzles created a community around the game, everyone trying to solve them as a group for several months. Even now, there are possible mysteries still unknown to most players. And that's not an easy thing to do. I mean... it's the Internet! I usually like to do a review to fully analyze each aspect of a game, going throught the graphics, music, game mechanics, some design flaws, etc. I'm pretty sure I'll run out of words going on about Fez. So I'll just try to convey what the game did differently from most games, and why you should or should not play it.I'll give its presentation a brief paragraph. If you're not saturated of the retro, pixel-art look, Fez looks amazing. Despite having a fairly simple visual style, it has a huge attention to detail, and lots of different kinds of areas, each equally impressive. I can't imagine how much work has been put into it, but the final result surely did not disappoint me.The music is equally good! It's mostly a relaxing kind of chiptunes, with the occasional darker tone. But it's really good, and I might listen to it outside the game, at times. I might also add that they never got repetitive, or just stopped out of nowhere. Everything there flowed perfectly.Regarding the controls, menus and interface, I didn't have a single issue with it, it had anything I needed.Onward to the game itself, then! Superficially, Fez is a 2D platformer with a particular mechanic: the whole world is actually a cube, meaning that you'll have to rotate its 4 faces to get from one place to another, and gather all the collectibles. This mechanic seems more of a novelty (and to a point it is, in terms of simple platforming), but turns out to be more important later on.There is barely any punishment for falling off platforms, and there's no combat, so Fez isn't a stressing game from an action standpoint. What you essentially do, is collect Cubes, to open gates. You can either collect an entire Cube from solving a puzzle, or you can gather 8 little pieces that form a single Cube. In the end, if all went well, you'll have collected all 32 Cubes. These can begathered by simple puzzling and platforming, a way of casually \"beating\" the game, for the casual player. To do it, the player has to go through each main areas of the game, each of them introducing a small mechanics. Some haverotational platforms and valves, one has invisible platforms (which the player can see through the rain bumping into those), etc. These are all simple, but keep the game from getting too stale.There are also Chests that can contain Keys (to open some doors into other areas), or Treasure Maps. These are mostly used for later puzzles.Seeing the game from this perspective, it's not as impressive as what comes later. But still, it looks great, and you can get some of the backstory from the ancient wall paintings, keeping the world mysterious.BUT. All over the game, the player will see hints at a previous civilizations. Maybe their ancestors. He'll see scribbles on the walls, paintings depicting some society, and later encounter different people in a whole different city, speaking a whole different language. During my first playthrough, I often questioned what these symbols were, but assumed it was mostly flavour text.That this, until I decided to look at the Achievements, and saw a weird one, with a pattern. I tried it in-game and got a special AntiCube. Just like a normal Cube, but dark. I went on to read about it, and found out there were another 32 AntiCubes, much harder to obtain. Well, my journey wasn't over just yet.In fact, the real game had just begun. And this was a totally different game.This time around, in NewGame+, I gained one new ability: first person view. I could stand and look around, this time, just to find more scribbles at certain places, inthe ground. To solve it, I had to decrypt the whole language of the world.There was a very cryptic clue that totally passed me by, and so I had to talk to the townsfolk and try to find patterns to decode all letters, one by one.Then, there was also a numeric system. Another one to decypher. There were QR codes (well, I just searched the pictures on the internet and then scanned them, only to find more codes in them).I waited by the ClockTower. I talked to Owls. I rotated the world to a beat. I've done everything I thought I'd never had to do in a videogame.Every single puzzle had a very subtle clue to it. Some I found and felt like a genius. Some of them I completely missed.The kind of puzzle complexity is Fez was something I certainly did NOT expect, and it only gets more complex near the end. But everything can be deduced from what the player is given.After all of that, the player can most likely go around the world once more, and see everything as a new man, with a deeper understanding of its surroundings, trying to fit every story bit into place.And that was great, even with the occasional aid of hints found online. (If you're having difficulties, I'd recommend finding just tips, and not an actual guide, so that you can do the detective work yourself, without having to be stuck for too long).Well, one of the later tasks was discovered by decoding the game's executable, and looking through the code for clues. Everything regarding the game has clues! The code, the assets, the achievements... it's really weird, but at the same time, really awesome! One thing I don't think the game does all that well, is giving the player enough information to what he should be looking into to solve the puzzles. Its puzzles are so diverse that the player can't get into a state of mind to solve them all. You'll have to go through it little by little, interpreting all sorts of different clues.And sure, that was most likely intentional, but I'm not sure about it working all that well, to be honest.It must have been amazing when the game came out, working as a community, trying to solve all of those cryptic puzzles. That's something that I don't remember any game doing without feeling a frustrating mess. It's something that Fez should be remembered for, but that also detracts a bit from the experience as a late comer. Most of it has already been done before, and you'll risk being too spoiled by looking at hints online.Another minor complaint you might have, is that the game is advertised as a platformer, more of a very complex puzzle game. And the platforming isn't spectacular, it's not the focus at all. And you might be right. But at the same time, it provides a different feeling of real discovery that you wouldn't otherwise get (oops, sorry for spoiling it for you).This was more of a rant than a review. But I can't really do a proper review of this game, sorry. I need time to digest it all, maybe even go through it once more in the future.And I'd like to read about it, or watch a deeper analysis on it. And all I see, is the Phil Fish drama. And it's a real shame.People have focused their attentions in the wrong aspect of Fez.This is a really unique and awesome game that should be remembered for uniting people into solving its deeper mysteries, in a fully fleshed out world, with its own culture!",

        "text": "[Old review deleted now that I've played the full version]Ok, Glitchspace is right between a positive and negative review. Above all else, while the idea of using programming to alter the environment is cool and full of potential, it's also too ambitious, when you realize how much you can actually do with programming.First off, the presentation. The visuals are a bit too simple, but I really like some of what they've done with it. The general \"divided square\" look is neat, and the color scheme is something you don't see too often, which is cool. Then, there's the sound. There's no music, per se, but the environmental sounds are rich enough that you won't need any. Some people find the sounds unpleasant, which I understand, but I think it works really well!It's mostly simple \"soundwaves\", which sounds very much like what you'd expect from a computer (you know, sine or square waves from the 8bit era). I think they've used them very well, especially given the theme. It's not groundbreaking, but I liked the atmosphere it provided.Now, the gameplay. This is all about manipulating specific blocks in the environment to do your bidding. It's about rotating, moving, applying force, etc. to these blocks to overcome certain obstacles.For example, if you need to cross a gap, you may want to make the platform bouncy, so that it applies an upward force to you when you collide.Or you can stretch it to make a bridge.Or moving it forward when you're standing on it.So, it seems that there are many ways of solving the same problem. Well, here, the developers had to limit your ability for each puzzle. So you're more or less forced into a solution.Unfortunately, the solutions are a bit too obvious, most of the time. And when they're not, you actually feel like they have limited your abilities too much, almost rendering it useless.This is the main problem. Programming is very rich and can let you do almost anything you can think of. So, to make a game about it, you have to limit players a lot. The main problem is how the game is about manipulating certain platforms, and not the programming itself? Like, in Human Resource Machine, you have some pretty tough programming problems. It can explore the programming itself.In here, you can only use bits of programming to change platforms. But it's like you're using a supercomputer to count to 10. The puzzles themselves don't even scratch the surface of what you could do by programing the platforms, and so most of the puzzles become too obvious, and not about programming at all.Later in the game, there are also a lot of mechanics added. If statements, referencing other blocks (so you alter block 0 with interacting with block 1), scaling blocks, lots of stuff. But these are never in your toolbox, so they only apply to a very few predefined sections.Which feels a bit incomplete, I guess? It's like a glimpse of all the stuff you could have had, but never really reach.The last level also illustrates the problem of giving you too powerful tools: By scaling object a lot, you can competely break the game, throwing you out of bounds, or, if lucky, getting high enough to complete the level in a dubious way. With the full power of programming, the game gets almost impossible to design. As it is, you feel like you're always in a very, very tight box that barely explores the possibilities it hints at.I could see an element of timing adding a lot more to the game (imagine SpaceChem, but in a platformer, where you actually have to time things to be at the right place at the right moment), or getting certain objects into certain pads, like Portal.This seems like it could create more \"complete\" puzzles, I guess? But it would be a wildly different game, so it's a bit pointless to keep writing in this direction.Overall, you may find it enjoyable. But it never gets \"there\".",

        "text": "Skyborn is a fun RPG, and deceptively simple!I tried to go into a in-depth review of it, but it turned out way too long, so I'll just go into a Pros and Cons type of points, with the full analysis for myself. If you're interested in it, I'll send you the whole review, just!Pros-Great world! It starts out fairly average, but it later reveals itself. It has a few interesting concepts, worth looking into.-Unique combat system. It's a mixture of the classic turn-based combat, with a few more modern Skills and Gameplay concepts, akin to MMOs, like a threat system, big focus on buffs and debuffs rather than pure firepower, and good interaction and role separation between classes.-It looks pretty good.-Music is simply fantastic! It really reminded my of Golden Sun. While it's not quite at that level, it's still very good, and it feels more modern sounding. I really liked it.-Provides a good challenge on Hard Mode without feeling too frustrating (until the last 2 Bosses, which are impossible unless you do absolutely every objective before heading into the final section of the game. However, nothing previously indicates that to be the case, which one is likely to miss, not realizing it until it's too late to go back.)-No random encounters! You can see those encounters on the screen, approaching at will.-Retry feature to get right back into a battle when you're defeated.-Good control scheme (I personally used a controller for a more laid back experience, and it worked fine).Cons-Lack of any resolution options, leaving you with a very badly scaled game in Fullscreen, or just a small window (the latter is recommended, Fullscreen looke hideous).-Poor interface design, looking very average, and not very functional.-The crafting system was awful to navigate, and didn't provide much benefit, as you could earn enough gold to render it useless, as everything would be for sale.-The game loved to surprise you with Boss Fights, and having you walk for half an hour if you did something wrong regarding leveling, or equipment. Some Boss Fights also appeared out of nowhere, sometimes making it impossible to procceed without reverting a couple of Saves.-Low amount of Save Slots (only 4).-The last few maps seemed a bit too clustered and confusing.-Lack of information. This game is not very informative regarding some of its details, leaving it all to trial and error. Sometimes, it can be very damaging to the player's experience. Every shop, forge (for crafting) is very far apart, leaving the player with empty hands for long periods of time.In the end, it was my downfall, as I literally couldn't go back, but HAD to, to be able to finish the game. Again, it does NOT give the player enough information for the player to make some decisions safely, but it was a big sore spot for me.Overall, Skyborn was an enjoyable experience. I liked a lot of it! But, looking back at it, it is also riddled with so, so many issues...!Some of those are inherent to RPGMaker, but some of those were also huge design flaws, which is disappointing.If you're looking for a JRPG with a more modern feel, give this one a try! I enjoyed most of it.Not recommended at full price, though, 15$ seems way too high for this game. It feels small at times,and just doesn't seem worth that price point, with so many amazing games at 10$.",

        "text": "\"Thomas Was Alone is a game about rectangles.\"What can one do with a rectangle? Well, jump. And have social issues. But mostly jump, of course.Starting out as a Unity project, it was eventually blown out of proportions. And rightfully so!Here are my thoughts about the game.Presentation-wise, Thomas Was Alone is a very minimalistic game, but still maintaining its own identity.It's almost like taking a platformer and keeping it to the bare minimum. On top of that, some modern lighting effects change it completely and make it surpisingly appealing.I really liked how the game looked, actually, and found it a very nice way of making a game look great without having to focus too much on expensive effects, models and animation.As a Unity game, it has what one can expect regarding options. Resolution options, audio sliders are there, and then also some presets for graphics. It's not a very intensive game, but it's good that they're there for older PCs. I didn't really have any problems running this game, no bugs, no frustrating interface, nothing. It's good when that happens.Music is an interesting part of this game. David Housden, the composer, decided to add a twist to the layered way of dynamically playing music in video-games. What he's done instead, is to separate each instrument and each melody, and have them play out randomly throughout the levels. This way, you'll rarely hear exactly the same sequence each time you play. The argument can be made that, musically, it may be worse. I can agree, but, in this case, the music is there more as a way to strengthen the atmosphere than to be played your MP3. And it actually fits the visual style, with an abstract and simple design. In my opinion, both the music and the sound effects complemented the game perfectly, I really enjoyed it!So, what's gameplay like?Thomas Was Alone is a platformer, with light puzzle elements. Thomas isn't alone. Each rectangle has a purpose in the game, each with their advantages and disadvantages. The objective is to reach the end of each level by combining everyone's strengths.It's pretty straightforward, actually.While there isn't really anything that will blow your mind regarding mechanics by themselves, it's still an enjoyable game to play. The Level Design is pretty straightforward. The levels don't pose much of a threat, making for a more relaxed experience. One commendation, though, is the amount of variety. There are 10 worlds, each with 10 levels. In each world there are new characters, with new mechanics and interactions, keeping it constantly fresh.And it's done in a way not to overwhelm the player with rectangles, which is good.There's more to it than one would expect from a game about rectangles, actually!Now, gameplay by itself doesn't make this game good. It would actually be a rather bland title just from a gameplay standpoint. Even coupled with the visual style and the music, it's not quite there yet. What's left, then?Well, the whole game is narrated. The narration, done by Danny Wallace, is mostly about the inner social struggles of each rectangle. AH! How could that ever work?!Well, it just does. Each rectangle has a very unique personality, directly linked to its shape (well, some are bigger, fatter, more athletic, etc.). Each character has essentially one main trait, which is actually enough to give them depth (but, but, it's a 2D game...), in the way they work together, and see each other. As the game progresses, the problems between them may or may not be overcome by the sheer power of cooperation. In most situations, I think these characters, if humanoid, would be seen as very bland stereotypes and taken as a negative. Somehow, by using a single shape to characterize a character, isolating one trait doesn't seem as negative. It's a different perspective, so that's cool!This may have all been rather accidental (i.e. not the point of the game when it started), but the fact is that everything works torwards the same objective. And, while the mechanics may not be very unique, when coupled with the actual personality of each rectangle, it all seems to create a very coherent and unique experience, in which you can't really draw the line between the world/story and the game itself. And that's something that many games struggle to do. In Thomas Was Alone, the story and world is told through the gameplay, through the characters, and through short narration in each level.It doesn't take that much resource-wise, surprisingly, but it may be very hard to achieve well (take Type:Rider, for instance).All in all, Thomas Was Alone was certainly a unique experience.It also manages to draw from a very common pool of emotions, so just about anyone can enjoy it. It's a charming and relaxing game, with a great amount of character. And rectangles. That's also a thing, here.One issue I have with it is the achievements. There isn't much of a point to them. Maybe it's just a way of having witty one-liners thrown around (?). Essentially, there are 2 collectibles in each world for you to collect. Even if you collect them all, there's no reward, other than showing off. These collectibles aren't particularly well hidden, they just blend a bit with the background. It's not a major problem at all, but I just didn't get the point of their existence in this particular game. Other than that, I think I enjoyed the whole game, actually.Go ahead and buy it!I completed the game in around 4 hours, so it might be a bit short for the price, in your opinion. I can't say much about it, but I'd say it's certainly worth the 10$, if it's in your range easily.",

        "text": "Master Reboot is a Sci-Fi First Person Exploration game, set in a virtual world dedicated to store dead people's memories and personalities, so that they're able to relieve their life, and also contact their family and friends, even after their unfortunate death.As you play, you'll uncover more about your past self and a bit about the world by visiting different memories.Sounds promising, right? Well, it certainly did!So, let's start with presentation. For me, the graphics were a mixed bag, to be honest. In the first level, you're greeted with amazing colors and lightning effects and just really polished graphics overall. While there are sparks of that throughout the rest of the game, it unfortunately falls a bit short of what it showed at the start.Texture work is almost inexistent at times, with a lot of the game beings mostly shaders and lights/shadows, and not a lot of details on textures, it's mostly just blurred colors.This makes the game look cheaper than it needed at times, specially since we had already seen a better work overall.On the other hand, the lighting effects are still awesome, and it's clearly a focus of the game's artstyle, specially inside the Hub World, with a very Neon feel to it.Besides, a really huge problem I had was with the brightness balance. This game is way too dark. Seriously, I wasn't able to see, at times (at the Hospital level, experimenting with the achievements). It was literally pitch black. I could change the brightness, BUT, you can't change the settings as you play, and the brightness meter isn't well calibrated, meaning that you can't really know when to stop. That's a bummer. I'll talk more about technical issues further.As I said, a mixed bag. Sometimes it looks awesome, other times it just feels rushed and cheap.Regarding music, though, I mostly enjoyed it. It has an eerie feel to it, but it's also beautiful, not just there to make you feel uncomfortable. Besides, it helps create an atmosphere in the several places you visit (i.e.: a circus).SoundEffects, on the other hand, felt a bit unbalanced (some of them genuinely bad), sometimes being too loud to the point of distorting the sounds. But, overall, they helped the atmosphere of the game.I think it has done its purpose, but overall, it could have been better.So, how's gameplay, one might ask?Well, this is where the game falls a bit too short. The game is mostly comprised of several areas (essentially 3 tiers that you unlock as you complete them), each with a certain memory. While there are bits of the game outside of memories, that's where most of the gameplay and exploration is set, so I'll focus on that.There's a hub area, in the virtual world, from which you can choose any of the areas of the available tier. These include place such as an Hospital, a Fairground, a Library, a Flight, and so on. You visit several places from your past life, trying to uncover exactly who you were, and who you were with.So far so good, I actually liked the structure of the game.In each area, it's more like a puzzle game. You'll have to explore the areas, and try to find out exactly what needs to be done. While you do that, there are little blue ducks, that give you pictures of a certain memory, a little piece of the puzzle of your past, if you will. These are usually fairly well hidden, and they're basically their reward for exploration. These areas, however, have two main problems. The first one, is that they're fairly small, rendering exploration a bit of a relative term, as there's not much to explore. Instead of exploring a big area, you're just looking under benches and the sort. Not very interesting.The second problem, is that most of the puzzles are fairly counter-intuitive, and have barely anything to do with your own purpose or memory. They're just... there. Acting as a hinderance more than a vehicle for the story. And that's unfortunate. They vary from too easy to random, for the most part. On their side though, is that they were certainly varied and SOME of them were pretty well thought and design. Unfortunately, the exception doesn't really make the rule.Most of the puzzles feel out of place and with solutions that aren't in any way tied to the memory.However, the areas weren't all just puzzles. They were actually very varied. The Hospital was more of a Horror-themed area, while the Flight was a stealthy mission. It certainly had more to it than I expected, but, the developers didn't seem either experienced or resourceful enough to do it all. The Stealth level was just frustrating at the beginning, but laughable once you figure out what to do. And the Horror level, somehow, managed to be less scary than other levels that were far more oppressive in a subtle way. In general, Master Reboot tried to hard to make a game out of the concept, and feeling a bit to shallow in that regard. I can understand why they've done it, but I think they only got sidestracked from the initial concept and ended up not doing either very well. One important aspect (for me, at least) is how they've done the achievements. Most of them are only there as an additional bit of challenge to the levels, but, once again, it doesn't add anything to the game. On the contrary, the way you're \"encouraged\" to play is actually less fun. On the Hospital level, for example, the achievements was to play without the Flashlight. \"Well, bring it on, then!\"... Boy, did I regret it. It didn't make it scarier. It simply made it frustrating. In many corridors there was literally no light. It was pitch black. I didn't know where to go, and there weren't really any distant visual or audio cues. It was just a case of pressing WASD and hoping I wasn't going against the wall. It was... not a good experience, from a gameplay standpoint.The other achievements seem to follow the same rule, being more of a problem than a cool incentive to play the game in interesting ways.Alright, gameplay is out of the way. Now comes the really disappointing part for me. You know, as this was an Exploration game in such a promising world, I didn't care about gameplay too much. I was just expecting great encounters and insight into this future society. Maybe even questioning Death. But... it barely happened, unfortunately.This game seemed the perfect way of throwing some ideas at the player through the world itself, but it did none of that. It simply turned into a dramatic story about 2 random people who created the Soul Cloud... just because. No philosophy behind it was explained or even refered throughout the game. It was created in the same way as Facebook, which is disappointing, to say the least.The world was there, and you were in it, but you didn't really feel a part of it in any way. In the end of each area you get a cutscene about your previous life, but it's just a story about love and friendship with a murder thrown' in the middle to make it seem dark. It's just... shallow, forgeting the initial premise. Maybe I was expecting too much. Or just something different. And this game wasn't aiming for it.Well, maybe. But even in that case, looking back at the game, there's no reason for it to standout, aside from the pretty lighting. Gameplay is just there just to call it a game, as it wasn't the focus at all. The story was far more generic than it could have been with the endless possibilities of the Soul Cloud. The world was far too empty as well, with more focus on real world memories than the virtual world of the undead. All in all, this game is just a missed opportunity. It was set in a great world, full of very interesting concepts. But, it does nothing with it, trying to be too much at once, ending up missing most of its points.It has impressive lightning effects and great audio design, but as a game... there's nothing I can't think of to justify a recommendation.",

        "text": "Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love is more of a sandbox than a traditional game. And this sandbox can also be seen as a metaphor for life. Which is a weird thing, and sets it as a very ambitious game from the very start.Now, whether or not this is my type of game, or I enjoyed its execution, let there be no doubt that this is certainly unique, and has its head on its shoulders.If you're looking for a good, traditional game, this is definitely not for you. On the other hand, if you like playing interesting games, with unique concepts, regardless of a flawless execution, then give this one a try.I decided to give a conclusion right at the start, because I honestly don't know if I should recommend the game. As a result, there you have the disclaimer. If you're still interested in reading my more in-depth thoughts about the game, go right ahead.From an audio-visual standpoint, Cube & Star is a very minimalistic game, with a very relaxing feel to it. There's no tension, no horror, no fast-paced action. You take thing as they come, and just hopefully enjoy the ride. There are no visual settings or anything, but from how the game looks, I don't think there's any need for it. It doesn't have crazy lighting and particles effects or anything of the sort. But it works, and I thought it looked pretty cool, specially seeing the world fading away in the horizon.If I have one complaint, is that the colors can be a bit blurred at night, making it hard to distinguish between them. But again, that's how night time is.Despite being very simple, I was satisfied about how it looked and sounded.Gameplay is a weird one for me. You're thrown into a very cryptic world with no goals, no enemies, no friends, no direction at all. The sky is the limit, they say. Oh, and you're a Cube. The first apparent objective for the player is to try and color the whole world. By hitting trees, they can drop either stars, or color \"seeds\". If you pick them up, your cube changes color, and spreads it as you walk by, progressively getting weaker, until it fades away and you need to pick more seeds. And I'll try to keep it more or less spoiler free.On the world, there are other creatures, each of them with their own purpose. Some are trying to carve colored paths, others are trying to erase the world of all color.You can talk to each creature, and they'll give you simple phrases about their purpose in life. Mostly flavor text, but it's a nice detail, and well written.Besides, there are also lots of collectibles in the form of history pages about the world's previous civilization, coins, gems, trophies, and each of them reflects on an arbitrary aspect of life, regarding work, greed, lack of purpose, etc.These collectibles appear when you color the respective square on the ground. So, as you're coloring the world, you'll get these. Why? I don't know. Do you? Must there be a purpose? And I think these are the question that serve as pillars to this game.Aside from these collectibles, you'll also get 4 powers. These powers essentially make you a God, and let you shape the world as you will. Along with this, there's a \"shore list\", or an \"achievement list\", to give you some purpose, if you need it. It guides you in playing a game in certain way, and it's a good thing, if you don't like being completely lost all the time.You're a God. A purpose-less one, but a God nonetheless. You can create civilizations, you can burn them, you can just let the game play out and feel happy to be a passive observer. And that can be relaxing. If you like the sound of this concept, you might enjoy the game. But it was not very much to my taste, to be honest, and there's why.The world is pretty huge, which can make it a bit too time consuming to walk from one point to another. As you color it, there's a map, with colored and grey zones. This is supposed to send you in a direction if you're missing something. But, since there are creatures undoing your work (in a very minimal way), you can never be sure where exactly you need to go, after a certain point, and there are a lot of people getting stuck at 90% of the world, and the sort. The same goes with the collectibles. If you don't know what's left to color, you don't know where the rest of the collectibles are.And, since the game is mostly about collectibles and coloring the whole world, it can feel like a shore.Now, it only feels like a shore if this is not your type of game, of course. I can see this being a very good game for some people. It has a lot to do, many interactions with the living world, with the colors, with everything. There's a lot that can be done!But I feel like this appeals to a very niche market.For everyone else, once you figure out more of less what to do, the game loses a bit of its compelling nature, since it's simply too laborious to achieve its purposes, once you set them.This is a game to play without purpose, honestly. It's a game for you to be immersed in, relax, and go in and out of it at will. Just enjoying your stay. And that's fine. I think it works for some people, just not for me.The game feels too big for what it is, and it can at times feel a bit empty. The map is very messy, as I stated. Besides, most of the achievements do not trigger outside of the game, which can be disencouraging for some people, so take that in mind.Also, note this, as I think it might be important: Most of the positive reviews have a very small amount of time into the game. These people have most likely appreciated for what it is for a short time, but rapidly moved on into something else.So yeah. Be careful if you feel like picking it up. The game has a very unique and interesting concept, but it is definitely not for everyone, and definitely not for me. If this feels like you cup of tea, go right ahead. There's a lot that can be done, and you can get a huge amount of time for your money, if you want to do everything there is to do. Otherwise, I don't think I'd recommend it. I enjoyed going through it, it was interesting, and refreshing. But I doubt that I'll play it again, and I certainly have left tons of content unseen. ",

        "text": "Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory is a 2D puzzle-platformer with a very colourful look to it. You play as a Sugar Cube and you go throughout 5 factories, each with its own theme and set of mechanics.I've played through the whole game and got every collectible in about 2 hours. If you're someone who's looking for a lengthy platformer with a lot of content, look elsewhere.As usual, I'll start out with presentation. As you can probably guess from the screenshots and its name, this is a game with a very child friendly artstyle. And whether or not you consider this a good thing, everything fits together quite well. Both the visual design, the music and sound effects feel to go well together, all working towards the same atmosphere.Animation isn't too detailed or smooth. It's actually very minimalistic, but it does the job. I personally didn't have an issue with it.So, all in all, I think they've done a good job there. On the other hand, this is a style that doesn't appeal to me, at all. Still, that's not enough reason for one not to play a game if it's good enough, but despite the game looking solid, it doesn't really stand out from the crowd of puzzle-platformers around, in my opinion.Now, the structure of the game.Bittersweet Factory is comprised of 5 different factories, each of a different ingredient. Each of these factories revolves around a couple of mechanics, mostly different in each one. There are 17 levels + a \"Boss\" level in the end of each factory, which start out by teaching the player the mechanics, and then getting a bit more complex. A negative aspect of it is that the Bosses don't really pose a challenge, and the only objective in those level is to avoid them, and getting to the door. Since this is a 2D Puzzle-platformer, its mechanics are the core of the game.As I said, each factory has a set of mechanics. These, however, are fairly generic, and can be found in a lot of other games. For example, different tiles and be sticky for you to wall jump, others are slippery to give you momentum, portals, etc.In the game's favour, they try to tie those mechanics logically with the candy theme, and do a fairly good job of it. But that's visually, as they can be (and are) disguised as virtually everything, being very common in most of these games.Now, its core mechanic is cool, but at the same time, a bit clunky. I liked the idea, but the execution felt sloppy at times, leading to some trial and error in levels, that could have been avoided.The mechanic is that each level is made of tiles, and each tile can be flipped, revealing a whole different level, at times. These tiles can be platforms, spikes, switches, you name it. You flip tiles as you walk by them, and there are \"powerups\" to change the direction in which you'll switch the tiles. Another very important aspect of it, is a way of not flipping the tiles (With Left/Right Button in a controller, or the Shift key). This way, you'll avoid flipping tiles that are needed for your destination more easily, and it's actually required in many levels.A big problem is that while there is some visual confirmation of what you need to flip, at times, it mostly comes down to trial and error. You'll find yourself trying to flip a whole lot of tiles at logical parts of the level until you find the best way. And, even when you did, it can be tricky to flip the right tiles at once (which is the reasoning for me finding it clunky at times).I have mixed feelings about the mechanics. I seems a bunch of canon concepts thrown into the levels, thinly held together.Level Design felt very similar, as a direct result of the mechanics. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. Besides, it was a very easy game. I'm usually pretty bad at these types of games, often getting stuck in many puzzles. This one, however, had me moving through it very quickly, barely having to think to solve each level, which is a shame. While being stuck at a level may be frustrating, it's also very rewarding to finally figure it out, and it's more often than not simple solutions that simply require a different thought proccess.While the tile flipping mechanic involves some of said change in thought proccess, the game didn't seem built upon it, but more as a common platformer.Final Thoughts?As a result of both its difficulty and artstyle, I'd find myself recommending it mostly for younger children, but not for anyone with any experience in these games, or simply looking for challenging puzzles. To be honest, it's a very hard genre to be in, with the huge amount of awesome games with very unique mechanics that are very closely tied with their worlds and characters.This game may be cheaper than most, but I'd still recommend something like The Swapper, Braid, Closure or Thomas was Alone if you're looking for a 2D Puzzle Platformer that's really good and/or unique.This game unfortunately doesn't manage to keep up with its rivals. Still, as a first entry form the developer, it's not too bad.",

        "text": "1953 - KGB Unleashed is a first-person point n' click that focus on a strong atmosphere and a keen eye to progress.I've finished the game in about 3 hours, and there is not replayability, unless you didn't understand the backstory and want to go back and read through the notes once again.This is a weird game. And it feels rushed at the ending, but I'd say that the path to get there was certainly interesting, at times unexpected.I went into it thinking it was an actual first-person game with free movement. As a result, I was significantly disappointed when I found out it was a point n' click. It makes for a clunky movement throughout the different sections of the game, and the mouse controls feel awkward at times.That said, you can look virtually everywhere around you.The game is set in a Russian bunker in a post-(second)war era. And it feel almost like Russian literature. This game is slow paced and very dense. Prepare for a whole lot of reading and trying to link what you read to the different puzzles within the game. This is not quite a horror game, but it certainly has some moments that might make you uncomfortable. Not too much of that, just enough. Those moment are only psychological, not visual, so worry not if you're sensitive to graphic violence, there's almost none of that.I'll start out by the worst of it. The game is very poor from a technical aspect. I didn't encounter any bugs, or major problems, but the game has no resolution options whatsoever. You play in FullScreen and in a fixed resolution, which is fairly low. Some cutscenes also take way too much down time, after they're over. They always take a few seconds to slowly (very slowly) reposition the camera... It's not a major problem, but it can be very annoying.Now, regarding the graphics. As I said, there are no resolution options, but the game can still look pretty good, and fairly realistic. If you look too closely, texture quality is surely dubious, but unless you're actively trying to do that, the game looks good. It's nothing impressive, since you're inside cimented walls, but the it does the job well. Nothing more, nothing less.Sound design is one of my favourite aspects of this game. Despite having almost no music, everything fitted perfectly. Even when you're reading notes (which you'll do a lot), the background noises never stop, and you can hear sounds from outside from time to time, reminding you of where you are.It's very ambience focused and minimalistic, but I think it was very well done! The game is fully voice acted, but it has no subtitles. One complaint I have with the voice acting is that it sounds American, where it should sound Russian. Since you're in Russia, the voice actor should at least have a characteristic accent... But there's none of that, unfortunately. But aside from that, the voice acting was fairly good.I will not spoil the story here, but I'll say this:It's supposed to be based on real investigations made by russian scientists during the war, and the way the game is structured fits that idea well. But it threads into paranormal territory, which I cannot say for sure wether or not it was even investigated or just game material. Either way, it was interesting, the way the story was told (or rather discovered). It was a bit short and felt rushed by the end, but I think it's a cool idea that could be fleshed out into something really good.Now, the most important part of this game: the puzzles and general pace.As I said, the game is very slow, and there is a lot of reading. But I say this not as a negative, but as a positive. And a warning.This might not be for you. You'll find a lot of notes and papers that either give you little clues to progress, or just some backstory to the game, for you to understand what might have been going on in that bunker. This makes it absolutely necessary to pay attention to everything you read and other world details, otherwise you'll get stuck and frustrated.I've seen some people say that the puzzles are illogical... Don't believe them. At all.The puzzles in this game were far more intelligent that I expected. I liked it. The problem with it is that something, some solutions are very apparent and require you to backtrack to places where you had already been.Your actions do have an impact in other rooms, but it's not very clearly what that impact is, most of the time. And that's the big problem here. One can't be quite sure when he has to go back or is simply missing something.But, that out of the way, every puzzle can be solved if you pay attention to the notes you read and they're very logical, in my opinion.There is no hand holding here. No hints, no anything. I'd recommend using a guide if you're not into solving these puzzles, but I think it takes a good part of this game out of it.This game was definitely a surprise, and despite the technical issues, it's was a very cool experience. The story surely gets weirder and weirder as you go along, but it has interesting ideas! If you're looking for a more psychological point n' click, go ahead and try this one one. But it's very short and doesn't feel quite complete.",

        "text": "Sacred Citadel is aan old-school inspired beat 'em up with some RPG elements and a focus on Co-op, set, of course, in the Sacred Universe.I have never played another Sacred game, so I couldn't really say how loyal it is to the franchise, regarding the setting and classes.Going into this review, I've finished the game with a character in single player mode. I've also tried every other character. Unfortunately, there were no online games up for me to try it.I haven't played many Beat 'em Up games, but I've played a few with unique twists and they're generally just pure fun!Sacred Citadel started out that way, and I enjoyed my time with it, I'll give it that. Unfortunately, it's very limited, and despite having good foundations, it seems very rushed and shallow compared to what it could have been.The game is structured with 4 Acts, each one with 5 different levels (including a Boss Level). Each act has a different set of enemies and takes place in a different place. You'll find occasional mini-bosses, which are essentially more powerful versions of normal enemies, and then a big boss fight that requires some pattern recognition.Between each level, the player can go to the Town, where he can buy Weapons, Armor, Gems, Potions, or make bets to increase challenge.Regarding presentation, I have very few criticisms. The game was made in 2.5D, with a clean, cartoony artstyle, and I really like it. it's colourful and the backgrounds look really good, in my opinion. There's also a decent variety in the levels to keep things fresh. The music is something that I have mixed feelings about. It sounds pretty good (perfect amount of organ - a lot!) and you can hear the old-school inspiration from it (more melody, less atmosphere), but it's very repetitive and gets easily lost in the background, unfortunately. I had the music volume up, but it seems to miss the *humpf!* to complement the combat. I like it, but I don't think it's all that great to go along the game.Still, it's not bad.SoundEffects were serviceable, nothing noteworthy. They do the job well enough.I'll talk about the features, and then go to the combat itself.In this game, you have a few RPG elements, as mentioned. By killing enemies, you get some loot, and experience. When you earn enough experience, you level-up, restoring your health right away. You can then attribute some points to Attack, Defense, Dexterity or Power, after finishing a level. You get 2 points per level-up. The loot is essentially Gold, Health and Potions, and then Weapons or Armour. You can use gold in the town to buy new equiment or bet. Potions can restore your health, have you do more damage, or restore your mana, which you use for special attacks.One major criticism regarding equipment, is that everything is literally an upgrade. There is no real choice or change in playstyle by picking up certain weapons or armour. You can have Elemental Damage/Resistance, but it doesn't change anything, combat-wise. So, everytime a weapon or piece of armour is dropped, you can equip it if it's better, or just leave it. It has virtually no impact in the game, aside from scaling your damage and resistance to the enemies. Missed oportunity, in my opinion. No variety, no change, no choice.Unfortunately, this game has no difficulty modes. The one thing you can do, is bet in the town, accepting challenges for an upcoming level. I love the concept behind this. It could make for a much better experience, fit for very different players. The downside is that it's not done right... at all.There are 3 types of bets. Life, Time and Score (Health requires not dying. Time is well... finish a level within a time limit. And Score is to finish a level with a certain score, earned by combos and the like). Each costs from 100 to 400 gold (scales with the Act), and you can only have one active per level. I suppose this was a way to improve replayability, but these challenges barely change gameplay at all to justify replaying them a lot. Besides, not all of them scale well. If you're higher level for a level, Health and Time become very easy, but Score is essentially impossible, since you 1-hit everything and cannot combo. Unfortunately, neither of them make the combat harder or anything, it only forces an artificial objective that helps absolutely nothing regarding replayability.Lastly, there are 4 classes: Warrior, Ranger, Shaman and Mage (if I'm not mistaken). Each of them have a different special attack, but that's about it. And it serves as a segway to the combat.Despite being a fairly fun game, there are barely any combos for the player to memorize, and you unlock them all within the first Act. That would be fine, if there were a lot of them. But it seemed to give you variety in combat for a while, and then it just stops, leaving you with barely anything to use. This makes the combat very, very repetitive and simplified, which is a big problem in a game that encourages replayability. You can not change classes as you want either. Each class as its progress saved, and you can get switch between them at will. As a result, if you want to try out different classes, you need to play the same levels from the beginning. Every character has personalized animations, and they're all fluid and look pretty good. But, every combo is essentially the same in every character, only with a different animation. Despite switching characters, there's no change in gameplay, rendering it all pointless. That's a shame, and it's the combat and its shallow systems that make me not recommend this game. Level Design is also barely existent. It's mostly pressing forward, with the occasional vehicle/mounted combat. The downside of it is that it's far harder to combat when you're in a mount, since you're thrown down of it whenever you're attacked, and the mounts attack much slower, being more of a pain in the ass than a good change of pace.The game was way too easy, even with challenges. The Bosses were fairly enjoyable, but mostly too easy as well, with the exception of one of them.Enemy Variety is pretty good, changing with each act, making for a more varied combat which is great. Flying enemies, however, were not very enjoyable to fight, due to their placing. Since there is a bit of a third direction in the game, flying enemies give a weird perspective, making them much harder to hit, and just clunky, really.It could have been a very, very good game. Unfortunately, despite the idea being there, it just doesn't do much to execute their ideas well. It's just the outer shell of a great game. I did get some enjoyment out of it, but it was a repetitive experience that tries to mask what it actually is by having some very artificial RPG elements.It's not a very good beat 'em up, specially when compared to some other great games out there.P.S.: I almost forgot. The voice acting in the game was really good! Despite being brief, it was really well done!Also, I saw many people complaining about bugs, specially online. Since I saw no one online, I can not test it, but I didn't encounter any problem in singleplayer mode. Only BIG complain about the port is the lack of option, specially resolution and aspect ratio.",

        "text": "Type:Rider looks genuinely interesting and it had my attention back when it launched on iOS.Unfortunately, after having completed it, I'm afraid it fails on its two major goals: being a good game, and being a different learning experience.Type:Rider is a simple platformer based around Typography. Every level is crafted from different letters (all themed according to a certain era and associated fonts).You play as ' : ', and traverse several different time periods, learning a little bit about each one.First off, presentation. As you can probably see from the screenshots, the game looks unique, and there's no argument there. Despite having a very simplistic foreground, each background gives the levels a very distinct feel, and often fit the font and time period. If nothing else, the game was a treat to look at.The music was pretty great as well, mostly fitting the rest of the levels. One big issue though, is that whenever I alt-tabbed, the music stopped (even after getting back to the game). Well, I alt-tab a lot. And that quickly became a big problem, as I was playing mostly with no music. It would be nice to see that fixed.Nonetheless, from what I've heard, the music was great!No complaints so far. Still regarding presentation, I must say that the interface was awful. This was an almost straight port from iOS, with big icons and way more navigation than it needed. Besides, the settings tab was almost hidden and while limited it had enough for the game it is (separate audio sliders and resolution options for the most part).Now that I'm done with presentation, let's see why Type:Rider fails as a game.This game is for all purposes, a platformer. And you play as ' : '. Despite looking cool, thematically, and working well, it's still a very clunky way of doing a platformer, and it makes it very easy to get stuck in a corner between the two dots. BUT, since the game is about typography, I'll let that one go.The game starts of waaay too easy and slow. Every level seemed just like going in a straightline, jumping above a ponctual hole. Despite getting much better as the player progresses, it's still a game that hardly provides any real challenge. It's literally a walk in the park. You're walking around looking at the backgrounds, and collecting extras (I'll get to those in a minute). It's really cool that the levels are made of letters, and it contributes for the whole theme of the game, but overall, there could be anything in place of those letters, as they're simply patformers for the player to walk on.In each level there are 3 things to collect. Letters (from a to z), another special character (&), and *.The letters are acquired naturaly throughout the levels, requiring no additional action from the player. The special  character is the hidden collectible in the game, with 1 present in each level (each with 5 stages).Both of these \"extras\" provide absolutely nothing aside from achievements and an \"Aa\" badge in-game. I don't even know why they're there. The only thing requiring a bit of exploration to find (and it's very little, to be honest) is the &, and even that provides you with nothing. I've only missed 1 on my playthrough, and I easily found it on my second try through the level.Then, there are  *. Each of these is also in plain sight, but they offer a page of information about the font and time period of the level. These are way cooler. I understand that they're supposed to be found by the player, but all of this makes the  levels way too linear, with no real challenge in them.There are some environmental hazards and tricky jumps in later levels, but even these barely feel a part of the theme, and the challenge they provide is questionable. The main challenge in the game is controlling the at-times infuriating ' : '.So, as a game, this is just a very bland platformer, clearly designed for iOS with very short and easy levels, plus a transvesti of exploration in the form of collectible achievements.Now, the way more interesting part of the game and why it made me play it. The theme and learning experience.Typography. That's a weird theme that they chose, isn't it? And yet, it's a very visual one, making a game the ideal medium for it to be taught on.Well, unfortunately, Type:Rider fails as making the game itself a learning experience. Despite the levels being very unique, thematically and feeling coherent with the theme and era, they provide little to no information. Simply playing the game naturally will teach very little, leaving only a vague idea of the particular font's origin and timeline.Sure, there are a couple of pictures of the style and machinery used in the background, but it's not very substancial overall.The way they tried to make it a teaching experience, was through collectible pages. The big problem here is, after you've collected them, you'll need to pause the game to read them. And that's pretty much it. It's almost like \"Hey, you've collected this *! Here, have a wikipedia article you can read! Learning in-game is fun!\". Well, no, it's not. It's just like reading a wikipedia article with the advantage of having the information a bit more streamlined. And that's not the point of educational games! Not at all. The mechanics are supposed to be the learning vehicle itself, complemented by its aesthetic. Not just making a pretty game with pages of text forced into it.Maybe the point of it wasn't to be the teacher itself, but to simply plant the seed of interest. Make the player interested in typography, and then tell him to go do his own research. Then again, this is not the way to do it, in my opinion. I didn't become interested in typography by playing the game. I was interested in the game because it had some apparent innovation.My conclusion regarding this. I think Type:Rider has an awesome concept, that I absolutely share and support. But, I think it missed its target in many core areas. The game itself felt very separated from the learning experience (visuals and music are  not enough). I like the idea, and I do not regret having tried it, but I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they were interested in it as a concept as well. And if that's the case, go ahead.There's a huge gap between gameplay and information. If you're looking for a great game, pass this one up. If you're looking for a completely different and innovative experience... not quite what you're looking for.It was fairly interesting, sure! And it did give me some curiosity about the subject. But I don't think this is quite what they were aiming for, and it will not appeal to the majority of people.Cool first try, but it needs much more until it becomes something truly good. -Great  visuals.-Great  music.-Great concept.-Generic  level design.-Bad  port.-Clunky  controls.-Interesting experience, but an overall a missed oportunity.",

        "text": "Little Inferno is a really hard game to do a review on. Aside from being completely unique, everything is a potential spoiler and just a product of interpretation.I'll talk about its 2 parts. I'll start of with the actual game mechanics, and I'll then talk about the themes it adresses and how well they're complemented with its mechanics.In Little Inferno you have but one objective. And that is to burn stuff. And then, buy more stuff to burn. As you burn something, you'll get just enough money to buy something more.That's the premise. Regarding presentation, the game if fairly minimalist, but also very unique. The graphic style may remind you of World of Goo, and rightfully so, as it was made by the same designer.As you spend most of your time burning stuff, it's obvious that the fire effects would be the focus here. And they look absolutely amazing at times. Perhaps not the flames themselves, but the whole dynamic smoke created around it, with which the player can interact (while waiting for something to burn).Simple, yet awesome visuals.The music is just as simple, and also really good! It's usually more in the background, but it does fit the setting pretty well, and you can clearly hear it in the needed moments. So, all in all, great sound design!Now, the mechanics.In this game, when you buy a certain item, you need to wait for it to arrive to your home. This starts out by taking a couple of seconds, but grows to as much as 5 minutes in the end of the game.If you're out of money, there are also spiders and other bugs that appear in your fireplace from time to time, that drop a coin after you burn them.Do you get it now? Seems an awful lot like \"cow-clicker\", right? Well, to a certain point, it is. But it's also much more than that. More on that later.There are 2 types of currency. One, is just coins, that you can use to buy more items, or inventory slots. The other one, is Stamps, that you can use to speed up the delivery process (1 Stamp for 30 seconds). You can see it as the \"Premium Currency\" in most social games. But you don't pay for it, of course.How does one earn stamps? By making Combos, which is the main mechanic of the game (aside from mindlessly burning everything you can!). Not unlike iOS and social games, there are missions. Achievements (in-game only), if you will. On this tab, all you're given is the name of said Combo, and the number of items needed for it (ranging from 2 to 3).There are about 100 different combos, but you only need to do 45 of them to be able to \"finish\" the game.Some of them are pretty obvious, others are far harder. What impressed me here was that some of them require were far deeper than I expected them to be, even if presented in a very light way. Just like the rest of the game, actually. It can have fairly deep interpretations, or it can not. Everything is very casually presented, never pointing fingers or judging anything. Just making the player aware of its message without trying to force it into him. And it does it very well!The game is divided into catalogues, each with a theme, and items about it. The Combos can be about one single catalogue, or include items from different ones. Initially, you only need money to unlock catalogues, but later on, you'll need stars to be able to access them (stars can be acquired by completing combos).And that's mainly it, really. While you do all this, you'll receive letters from 3 people, but this fits more into the subjective nature of the game, and not as much to the mechanics, as a game.As a conclusion about gameplay only:It's a very limited game, and despite all the work put into the synergies between some of the items (and some were really, really good! I loved most of them), it's mostly flavour, and not a lot of meat. And that was intended, making it harder to criticize.Regardless, if you're looking for a challenging game, or a traditional game, stay away from this. It's not why it was made, and I doubt you would appreciate it if you went into it looking for that. This is mostly grind and no challenge in terms of gameplay.The game can be a bit boring and laborious at times and to be honest, I think it overextended a little bit. The points could have been made with less grind, but it's hard to say.So, why is it good?The game adresses themes related to the rise of social games, so called \"cow-clickers\", and how people waste their lives in front of the screen, doing nothing.The point of the game is to burn food, toys, statuettes, ... everything, really. Things with inherent value to them, and yet... you're just burning it all. The world is a cold, scary place outside, so you simply burn everything that can remind you of it. You don't think about why you're doing it, you simply do it. You and probably thousands of others. But you can't really be sure, you only know 3 people! As I said, the game isn't trying to criticize or make fun of anything, necessarily. It simply presents the subjects to the player, and never really opinates on it. It's all left to interpretation. It would have been easier to point fingers and laugh, but no. Little Inferno is classier than that.Another important aspect, is the context of the game. Right now, the closest connection might be casual games, but the same can apply for countless other situations, it's a pretty versatile metaphor.This game can lead to way more discussions that I can write about right now, and most of them would probably spoil the experience.I tried not to give away too much about it, but I'm not sure I've managed that very well.If you're looking for a completely different that will make you think, pick it up, it's really great! If you're looking for a challenge, don't do it. It's not the point of it and it will probably leave a really bad impression on you.Buyer beware: First off, the game doesn't make its point very clear very fast. It will test your patience before showing its cards, mostly in the ending.Second, the game was trying to burn my graphics card (how ironic, isn't it? I hope that was not intended haha!) due to a lack of V-Sync. You can however enable it directly in the settings documents. Go to user/.../AppData/Roaming/Little Inferno/settings.txt and change the option from 0 to 1, and save the file. That solved any issues for me.This was a really awesome experience overall. The path wasn't the most enjoyable, but the ending made the whole thing fit, and worthwhile.It's great to be surprised by small indie teams with titles like Little Inferno. Give this one a try! ",

        "text": "Strider is freakin' awesome!I'm pretty convinced that this is one of the best 2d sidescrolling action game to come out in the last few years.This game isn't really innovative in any way, but what it does, it does almost perfectly. Well, yeah, I enjoyed the game a whole lot.Strider is like a Metroid-vania, with its focus on combat and movement rather than exploration. Don't get me, wrong, the exploration is definitely there, but mostly if you're looking out for all the extras. If you don't really care about exploration and extras, you can still play it for the action without it being a subpar experience.It took me 10 hours (I assume excluding deaths and down time) to 100% the game on Hard Mode.I will eventually go back to it for the challenges and even a Normal Speedrun under 4hours. I've seen someone do a 37minute run, so there's that.Length feel pretty go to me, but that all depends on wether or not you're one to explore the levels or simply rush through.There are Speed and Combat challenges you can unlock, so there is something more to do besides the Campaign.Starting with the presentation.A lot has been invested into making the game look really shiny, and also into its lighting effects. Well, it looks really great, and, despite having heard of a few performance issues, it ran very smooth for me all the time.Throughout the game you will visit several diferent areas, although they all look very industrial and that's my only criticism about the graphics. Due the whole industrial look it feels too same-y at times. But it still looks great, and every background is highly detailed. One can clearly see the work DoubleHelix put into making Strider a more than worthwhile experience.All the lighting effects from the weapons and special attacks look very polished as well and make combat a treat to look at while you cut enemies in half!Animation quality is top notch as well, everything is really fluid, making the combat and the platforming very responsive and satisfying as a result!Even jumping around is fun with the signature star jump!Regarding graphics, the other criticism I can think of is that the character models can look a little blurry and low quality in the cutscenes, since they're much closer to the screen.During the game sequences however, they definitely look awesome and it's understandable why they wouldn't use higher res textures for that.Now, regarding the music. This was a bit of a disappointment for me.I haven't played the previous Strider games, but at least from the other old-school sidescrollers I've played, music has been a real focus and often a spotlight for the games. In Strider however, the music never really gave me the kick while fighting or anything. It wasn't bad, on the contrary, but it didn't really seem to drive gameplay in anyway and seemed to be there for the sake of it. It doesn't detract from the experience, but I did expect something more from it. Ah well...Now, the real meat of the game.Combat in Strider is really fast, and gets progressively more complex as you progress through the story. You have simple attacks, an Uppercut, and Slide, and you then unlock Kunai throwing, and Downstrike, a Teleport charge attack and several 3 other Special Attacks. Then, you have 4 weapon types (Explosive, Frozen, Reflective and Boomerang), with different purposes and secondary effects, which affect both the Kunai and the Teleport.It's all fast and furious and it's surprisingly responsive!Certain enemies require the player to use a certain weapon type to break their shield before going all in against them, and it creates some more challenging sections. Some people don't like this type of combat, but it doesn't really bother me, and adds something to the combat, so I'm fine with it.The only complaint I have with the combat is the lack of combos. Since you don't have a big variety of moves, you can't really get enemies into the air for 5 minutes and feel like a badass. Well, you still feel like a badass (!), but there's none of those long combos. Level Design was really good, despite some big flaws (for me). You have a bunch of different areas which you can travel to, each with a ton of secrets for the player to explore at will (Extras, Upgrades and Costumes) and generally a Boss Fight.Some of the Extras are really well hidden, and will require a decent amount of skill from the player in using every tool available. Each area is fairily long, and labyrinthic at times, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The difficulty comes mostly from the Extras exploration, and none of it will hinder your game progress if you're not actively looking for those.Now, here are my flaws with the Level Design. First one if the Checkpoint System. This is a really incoherent aspect of the game, sometimes saving after Boss Fights, sometimes not really. Besides, some checkpoint are very close to one another, and others are pretty far apart, or have a particularly challenging section between them... This leads to very frustrating deaths at times. Besides, if you die, everything you did after the checkpoint is gone, including all the Extras. That's even more infuriating when you quit the game after beating a Boss and realizing that a bunch of your progress has been ignored.Another huge problem I had with it, is that you can't really get back to the game after you finish it. And if you want to 100% the game, you need to do it before the last area. They do give you a warning not to go there before collecting everything you want, so that's good.BUT, it completely breaks to pace of the game. Right before the ending climax, you'll have to stop everything and go through some sometimes laborious exploration. More on that here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/235210/discussions/0/558752449340022157/Now, regarding difficulty.The game had a few challenging sections and Boss Fights, but it was mainly way too easy for an old-school inspired game. I've managed to beat most Boss Fights on my first try, maybe second.The beginning was the hardest part of it, as you had no upgrades and there were bullets flying from all over. And that felt great!The main problem is that, since the checkpoint system is very unforgiving and incoherent, making the game hard would probably be too frustrating. Now, regarding the Extras.You can explore to collect Concept Art, Character Models with descriptions, and also Story Intel, with a bit of info about Strider's Universe. I find that pretty great, although it would have been nice to be able to listen to those texts while playing, instead of having to pause and read them. But, voice acting would be costly, so that's enough, I guess.Aside from those, there are Costumes.These are purely cosmetic, and only change your colour, and give you a little information about whose Strider that suit did belong to. If you collect all of them, you can change each piece of gear and customize it to your taste. Overall, Strider is one very good Metroidvania game with more focus on combat rather than exploration, despite having and doing both equally well!It makes you feel like a badass throughout the whole experience, and mixes some of the best old-school and modern design choices into one game. One thing I didn't mention were the Boss Fights. For me, those were a mixed bag, but mostly great. Some patterns seemed to random to avoid, but they were mostly accessible, and pretty straightforward once toy learned each Boss (and a similar thought goes into every enemy).If you like this genre, or are simply interested in Strider, go ahead and buy it. It's awesome!",

        "text": "Wow. The amount of positive reviews impress me here. I was willing to try this out after reading a couple of them, even if the \"hidden objects\" genre isn't something I'm into at all.Still, it looked fairly good from the screenshots, and so did the setting. I decided to play it.Infected: The Twin Vaccine is mostly a story driven \"game\", and it's clear the story was in fact the main focus. As for gameplay, it has elements from point n' click games (you go some place and collect an item to use on another place, and so on and so forth), and sections with Hidden Objects and also a couple of Mini Puzzle-ish Games.In the story, a strange virus is set at large in Oxford, the first two cases being two Twin Sisters. One of them died, the other one seemed immune, and it's your job to find her, to find a cure for said virus.The town is essentially deserted, and there's no trace of the little girl, and so you look around trying to find her, meeting two other people along the way.So far, so good, right? Well, yeah. The story had its interesting moments. Nothing to write home about, but nothing too bad either, and the way they've presented it through cutscenes and other environmental notes was cool.First off, the presentation. The game doesn't look too bad, and it has a weird mix of real photographs and actors, who were all digitalized and changed with filters and the sort. It's not particularly good looking, but it doesn't look bad either. One big complain is the severe lack of options... resolution options mostly, they don't exist, essentially.Well, it delivers the intended experience, so it's fine.The music was pretty good at times, painfully generic at others... Again, it does its job. It doesn't really detract from the experience, and it sometimes helps with the atmosphere.One great thing I'll say though: the developers were smart enough to offer the player a significant amount of options regarding difficulty, with several setting that could be changed, for example, glowing objects, time between hints, tutorial, and so on. That's always a plus to give the player the opportunity of tweaking with the game to match his/her perfect experience. Well done on that!Now, the gameplay, and this is where it goes downhill.First off, the interface is awful, and the keyboard simply doesn't work. Not that it would be too needed, but it would have been nice to have some hotkeys. Escape doesn't even work for the menus or closing pop-ups. You've got to click everywhere... Not good. It's a PC game, come on! It's not like it's too hard...Now, the rest of the game. Mostly, the puzzles consist of going around experimenting with random objects, praying that something works. Most of the stuff doesn't make much sense anyway. And the worst part is the coherence part of it all (or lack of it...). Throughout the whole game, you'll find Hammers, Flashlights/Lanters, Crowbars, and specially Fire Extinguishers (you can never put out fires the way they're supposed to...)... and you never keep them. Ever. It's all temporary, and you'll find yourself going around looking for the exact same items you had already picked up! It just makes no sense! And also the fact that you could clearly use a certain combination pretty well, but the game simply doesn't let you, because you were not intended to.Another big problem, is that the player character is the most useless person on earth. He can't even skip one step, having to combine 5 items and act like a engineer before he climbs the damned stairs...Another example is when you have a freaking crowbar in your hand, but you can't break a window. Why? Oh, you needed a Baseball. To throw at the window. Twice....You can't open a cardbox either. You better get a knife, hidden inside a very well hidden box for which you need 4 keys spread around the house. Just because...Well, overall you also just match patterns randomly (like puzzle pieces) so that they open some random drawer with some random item you need to open another random drawer! That's this game's logic, and it pissed me off at times. There was barely a single puzzle that made sense!Then, you have the Hidden Object sequences. These were the worst. You just collect an assortment of items to get to other items that make no sense, only to reach a final item, that one wouldn't even need all that much. Not to mention that every place is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mess, with all sorts of objects on the floor. Who even put half of those there? It's like someone emptied the trash on the floor so that the player had to go look for whatever key!It's just awful... and that's why I don't get the good reviews. Sure, the story was fairly good (just fairly, really), but the gameplay was just awful!And after watching the Behind the Scenes video, I got the impression that they didn't care for that in the least! All they wanted was to present their story, and just threw the gameplay bits 10 minutes before they finished the game. It really made no sense, and was not enjoyable in the least.Nothing in the video mentions gameplay. Nothing. Well, I guess that explains it. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the last \"optional\" chapter. This tell the story of the girls' father... sort of. But it look like an early prototype. The game looks far cheesier and cheaper, and the best gameplay aspects weren't there at all! It just a bad demo entitled \"bonus chapter\".The main game was already bad, but that was even worse! I don't know what these people were thinking. They had a decent idea for a story, and they've decided to make it a game. Without considering how the game should be played in the least!It's just an awful game. No value here, in my opinion. If you're looking for a story driven with almost no gameplay on it, I'd recommend 39 Steps. Barely any gameplay there, but it's a really good effort nonetheless, and far better than this in every way. I'd also recomment the developers to give it a look. Maybe you would then seen how you could deliver a story in a game-like way without ruining the experience with really bad gameplay.Not recommended, at all. But it's not all bad. The feel of the story and characters were fairly interesting, but all the rest was just bad, sorry to say. It can be improved immensely and maybe even be turned into something good, but as it is, stay away.",

        "text": "My favourite genre is probably the Metroid-vania type of games. Mostly because they have just the right amount of combat, action oriented gameplay, and then also some necessary exploration! Seeing Guacamelee, it interested me greatly, both because of its genre, and also because it \"draws from Mexican culture\". Why make it all up when we have cultures full of interesting folklore already? So, I was pumped. And I now stand really impressed. This game blew all of my expectations out of the window, and here's why.First off, the presentation. The game looks gorgeous and unique. Enemy and character design overall was very detailed, and it looks really great. Everything else isn't anything to sneeze at either, it looks pretty good overall, although the characters were what stood up for me. Some parts of it can look to same-y, but it has a bunch of different areas to keep things interesting.The music wasn't something that I'd listen to out of the game, or is stuck in my head. But it fits the setting really well. and makes the experience more atmospheric. Another note on the presentation: there are tons of stylized references to multiple videogames, specially in the form of posters in town. Those are all \"revamped\" to fit the setting, but anyone can see who/what they're referencing. And the most important thing: those weren't just references because \"it's cool\". One can clearly see that they've seen what made those games great, and they've managed to put most of those aspects in their own game. More on that later.So, gameplay. In Guacamelee, you have a lot of combat and platforming, and they both behave very closely to one another, because the special moves you use in combat, you'll also need to platforming, be it to reach an higher platform, to stand in place until a platform moves, etc. And platforming scales really well, starting out pretty easy, and getting more and more difficult as you progress. The same with the combat, and here's my biggest complaint: the game was way too easy. The harder parts were actually \"optional\" as part of secrets, and exploration. I'll explain it in more detail further.As you progress the game, you gain several abilities (by breaking Metroid-like statues) and those will help you in both combat and platforming. Combat was surprisingly good, as the player could pull some really long combos, and it wasn't too hard to make. And the combat never felt like a button-masher, and dodging is also an essential part of it.The Boss Fights were also impressing. Each Boss has several phases with different pattern that the player should memorize. Unfortunately, once more, they were way too easy and didn't provide much of a challenge, despite the fight being enjoyable in itself. Also, the last Boss fight had a weird hitbox that messed it up a little bit. Nothing game breaking though, it just felt weird.To keep going forward, besides unlocking new abilities, the player should also explore to find Money (to buy Costumes for different playstyles), Health and Stamina (what is used for special abilities) around the world. These are the sections that usually provide the biggest challenge in terms of platforming, and they were really enjoyable!These require the best use of all the abilities the player had learned up to that point. And this is what mesmerized me: this game does a lot of things right! Platforming, Combat, Exploration, the World, and I could go on. They've taken some of the best aspects of previous game and made it their own, and they've done an amazing job here!They've taken a similar respawning system as in Super Meat Boy for the hardest platforming sections, and a Metroid-like transformation to reach tighter places, just for two very obvious examples. The point is, the references are there not just as a nice poster, but also deep in the mechanics of the game, and I'll applaud the developers for that. Great job!On the exploration side, there are also some mysterious \"Orbs\" that are very well hidden, and present the most hardcore platforming in the game. Nothing is told to the player about what they're in the game for, and it made me go all in to find them. Some of these challenges could get somewhat frustrating, but it's good that they're there! Some challenge, at long last! Well, unfortunately, I only went to find them after I had 100% each zone, and the reward wasn't very useful to me. So, I won't spoil it, but you should try to find all of them right away. The last one you can only obtain after defeating the last Boss. All in all, they were worth it.The DLC provides 17 challenges that are also very enjoyable, ranging from combat to platforming and rancing. They were all well done and provide additional challenge and add new suits with different attributes which is always nice to keep things fresh!So, overall, I really enjoyed all of my time spent with the game, and have found explored 100% of the game's areas, and it was all worth it. The sidequests all had character to it and were pretty amusing, adding a bit to the world and setting of the game. It did more things right than it had the right too, which was impressive! Sometimes, it felt too ambitious with it, but those feeling were far minor compared with the positive aspects of it.Now, I'll get on with the bad parts.The first one is one I don't understand, and almost despise. They've decided not to include Hard Mode until the player finished the game. And there was no NewGame+ option. What the hell? Why? Seeing as the developers went deep into many games to see what they did and didn't do right, how did they reach this conclusion?Normal Mode was by far too easy! I barely felt challenged at any point, and it highly detracted from the experience, specially after seeing \"You've unlock Hard Mode!\"... It's not very enjoyable repeting the whole game, specially from the 0! If there were a NG+, I might've done it, because I still needed to unlock some Suits and Explore part of the world. But having to do everything all over again just harded didn't really feel very nice... So, I've done almost everything to do in the game, with the exception of playing the game in Hard Mode. A game that I've found too easy... I don't understand this decision, honestly. I just hoped the developers realize this mistake and don't make it in future games, because I sure look forward to them now! If I'm the one missing something with this, feel free to reply and tell me, but I really hate to have to repeat the whole thing to play the game as it was intended.Another thing, is the fact that the exploration isn't all that rewarding, since the player doesn't really need to upgrade to beat the game. And, specially after the end of it, exploration was mostly there for the achievements (except for the SideQuests, which were genuinely amusing, and some optional secrets along the way).I'd also like to make 2 constructive critics.One of them is about the Map System. It was pretty good, letting the player know where previously encountered coloured blocks were in the map (these were areas blocked until the player gained X ability), but some areas were not as direct or evident and easy to see by looking at the map. As such, a nice addition would be a sort of \"Note\" system in which the player could right Notes and a certain point in the map for further reference.Another one, is about certain achievements. There were some for beating the Bosses or Arenas on certain conditions. These made the fights harder, and more interesting, which is a plus! But there was no way of knowing about them without browsing the achievements. many players probably missed enjoyable content because of that. So, a cool addition would be to add a Tab for Optional Objectives so that the player always knows what can be done.Well, that's all from me. I loved this game and I certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the genre! Cheers!",

        "text": "Finding Teddy is a point n' click puzzle in which you play a little girls whose teddy-bear has been taken by a weird arm from the closet during your night. What else would you do? Just go through the closet to get it back! Then, you find yourself in a wonderland.There, there are \"monters\" which you need to help, and they help you in return. Otherwise they'll just eat you. That's life.Point n' click games aren't really my kind of game, and this one doesn't change that. It has the aspects of those games that I don't like, such as very slow and little actual gameplay, and puzzles are sometimes too cryptic and turn into a click-fest.But I certainly liked this game quite a bit, and it has certain aspects that make it unique.First off, the artstyle. Despite very minimal, it's really well done. Every scenery looks very good, and the world seems alive because of it. You can see it from the screenshots, it almost gives me a Sword and Sworcery feel, but still stands on its own. Nothing to complain in this regard, and it's one of the aspects I liked the most.Music didn't really standout to me, it was more ambience oriented, and that's ok, but I didn't find it particularly good. I wasn't bad either, but I barely payed notice to it. I'm talking about general music, and sound effects. Then, there is a really cool mechanic with it, about which I'll talk further.Gameplay is mostly standard point n' click. You click on the edges of the screen you want to go, or the item you want to pick up. Then, you click on yourself if you want to use items. So, pretty standard, I'd say.But, you eventually get a flute. With this flute, you can play different notes and pitches, and each note represents a letter of the alphabet.With this, you can interact with some characters, and even try to translate what they're saying by finding which letter matches with a sound. This is something I've never seen before, and it works well, for the most part. Other times, you have to respond back, choosing the letter, and so creating a melody. This gives a whole new aspect to both the mechanics and the world, and it's what makes it truly unique!A big complaint I have with it, though, it that the background music sometimes overlaps with it, making it a bit too hard to figure out which sound you want. That's was really annoying at one point, but nothing you can't solve.You go through 3 different stages, with different characters, and then you have a final \"boss\", which is all about communication, with a little easter egg in there. In each stage, you have some optional monsters that may or may not be necessary to progress the story, and you should pay attention to them, because the Boss is mostly about things you've experienced before in the game.Unfortunately, you can probably finish the game in a single hour, or so. Then comes NewGame+. I think this one was pretty bad, to be honest. The wonder and surprise from the first walkthrough is mostly gone, and you're left to \"collect\" Fireflies that appear on some areas. These aren't really hidden or anything, it's just about playing the game once again. Plus, it's a really cheap way to increase the game's longevity... why not give you the option the first time?Aside from the fireflies, you can have a different look to your character, which could be cool... but whenever there is a scripted sequence, your character changes back during it. I don't know why this happens, but it feels very awkward. Would be nice to see it solved for future players. Nothing too bad, but an annoyance nonetheless.Along with this, the achievements were mostly really bad, in my opinion. Half of them are to reward you for dying in each encounter. Instead of rewarding to figuring out things before hand, it rewards for failing. ... Why? It makes people purposefully failing if they want the achievement and have played well on their first time... It makes no sense to me, and it is the exact opposite purpose that achievements should have. My final complaint is not being able to Alt Tab the game, or even changing options during gameplay. There are no sliders for the music and SFX, Alt-Tabbing doesn't work, there are a lot of annoying things about it in a technical level. These could be very easily solved, but the developers seemed to have taken the easier way out and just made something quick that worked... somewhat.I've done everything there was to do in the game, it took my 2 and 1/2 hours, in 2 playthroughs, which is really short.If you can withstand all the technical issues and annoyances, you'll actually find a really pretty game with some unique features to it. I think it's worth playing once only, in my opinion. I'm interested what else can be done with this concept, and I'll be paying attention to you, \"LookAtMyGames\". Go ahead and try it, it has its strenghts! ",

        "text": "I'm amazed with this game... I really am. I had my eye on this game due to its peculiar art direction with the whole matryoshka theme. And, being from Double Fine, it should be good! Although I haven't really heard much about it, which now surprises me. I'm yet to play Psychonauts, but so far, this is their finnest! (...)On to the game. Stacking is a third person Adventure/Puzzle game, in which you play Charlie, the smallest doll of all. The game is set in the industrial revolution era, a place where there's a tyrannical Baron who exploits workers and/or children. Your brothers and sister and taken by him during a workers' strike, and so you're on your newly found quest to rescue them, and find your father, who disappeared to pay off the family's debts.PresentationThe art direction in this game is amazing! Everything shows character and is highly polished. In this regard, I can't find any flaws, really. The screenshots don't do it justice, but you get the feel of it. The cutscenes are done in an old movie style, without any speech and then added text, with fitting music. Despite the dolls' shape, their animation gives each of them a very unique feel, even in the way they walk and talk, which isn't something anyone could pull off.The music fits every scene really well, with handpicked classical pieces, which contributes to the very unique atmosphere of this game. Even if you're not a fan of classical music, I'm sure you'll find it in its right place here. As for me, this might have given me the will to explore classical music a bit more. It's one of the game's spotlights for me.Presentantion is simply excelent! I'm surprised with how they've managed to do it so perfectly, I really am. From the animation, to the cutscenes, the music... everything is just awesome and you'll find yourself just stop progressing and look around for the sake of it.GameplayThis is where this game is truly inovative, it blends mechanics with the world it's set it, gameplay and the artstyle just fit perfectly.Due to your size, no one pays much attention to you. This is where the main mechanic comes in. You can Stack into other dolls that are one size bigger than you, and those can stack into others that are one size bigger than them, and so on.There are Unique Dolls, with a name and a backstory, and a very personal feel to them. Then there are types of dolls, mainly a satirical depiction of their \"class\", I'd say. Every unique/type of doll has its own special ability that will help you solve puzzles or just interact with other dolls to simply have fun with the game!In the main game you have 4 main areas (one of which is like the Hub area, which gets more quests as you progress) in which you rescue your family, solve puzzles and just joke around, each with a theme to it. Another area and sidestory is added in the DLC.Each area the main quest, divided into smaller puzzles. To every puzzle you have from 3 to 6 different solutions, which are accomplished by stacking with the right dolls and using their abilities accordingly. You only need to solve them once to progress in the story, but replayability is highly encouraged in this game, for various reasons. Every solution is very creative and actually pretty fun, so I'd encourage you to try to get to every solution even after finishing the game, as you can go back to every area at will. The in-game hint system is actually very good, giving you little hints that will definitely help you solve some of the puzzles without spoiling it all for you!Aside from the main quests, you have Hi-Jinks. These are essentially challenges to your creativity with the different dolls and interacting with each other to comical effect. Each area has a bunch of them, and I can't stress enough that you should definitely try them all, every side objective in this game rewards you.In the main area of the game, you have the friend you meet at the start of the game, and he essentially keeps track of your progress, and creates dolls, wall paintings and puzzle pieces for each solution and unique doll found. In the end of the game, it's awesome to go meet him and see the whole cast of characters and locations in a sort of secret exposition.This is a reason to do the sidequests and challenges, but do them for the sake of it, because every single one of them is very fun to do!StoryThe story is pretty straightforward, but it actually has many nuances to it and follows the world hand in hand, leading with some serious issues in a very casual and humorous way.  It's not something I'd examine very carefully, but I like that it's there, and it helps you understand the characters and the world better.ConclusionAs if what I wrote was not enough, this was a truly brilliant game, in my opinion!Everything fits, the world feels alive and is just eye-candy. While I'm not much of a puzzle game fan, this one pulled me in and made me keep playing until I've absolutely finished everything there was to finish in it! If you're intrigued by it in any way, go ahead and buy it. I'm sure you haven't experienced anything like it so far, and it's great to see some developers doing something they like and being inovative... and succeeding!From the music to the artstyle and game mechanics, the writing... I can't find anything worth complaining about. The only problem one might have with it is the fact that it's a puzzle game, but the fact that it has several solutions makes at least one of them fairly easy to get, even if a couple of them were a bit hard to get if you hadn't talked to the right people.Enough of this chatter. Buy this game if you haven't already, it's awesome!",

        "text": "I was very pleased to see this game after playing Punch-out! (Mike Tyson's Punch-out!, for the NES), as it's not the type of game you often see.Don't buy it thinking it's Punch-out. It's actually a significantly different game, with different mechanics, that stands on its own! If you enjoyed it, you'll probably like this one as well, but they're fundamentally different games.With that out of the way, I'll now describe what I like (or not).The most obvious think here are the graphics. The game has quite a lot of character to it, and the visual style of the game suits it surprisingly well. Although the models are questionable (you can see the polygons clearly in some characters and animations), the textures manage to hide that pretty well, and make the game look awesome! Personally, I think the game looks great, but it might not be your thing... I guess you can decide that from the screenshots.As a segue... the music. It's very good! And it's varied enough, each stage giving a different vibe, matching the opponent as well. One complaint I have it that the music doesn't loop very well, most of the time. In combat I didn't really notice it much (maybe because there wasn't enough time to notice), but on the menus it's pretty apparent... and feels awkward. I think there could've been more polish into the ending and starting of the tracks. Other than that, it's awesome, good job!SoundEffects weren't really something I enjoyed a lot. I found them a little annoying at times, with some high-pitched sounds, but they're bearable.Now, a problem I've had with this game was the Interface. The style of the menus were a bit out of place, but that's not the main problem. Navigating through them is slow and unintuitive with a controller. I guess a mouse helps it greatly (since this is a PC), but for a game like this, I prefer using the controller. Also, key bindings were very awkward with the shared functionalities. When you change a certain key, it might have 2 functions at once, which you can't change separately... that makes it weird with a couple of keys. I think the game would have benefited quite a lot from having all the keys able to be rebound, and a reworked interface. Ah well...Options menu was a bit lackluster as well, but at least it had separate audio sliders... That's a plus and some games fail royaly.So, all in all, presentation was pretty good, despite having a clunky interface.Now about the gameplay. In this, you have essentially 3 modes: Carreer, which is separated in Tournament and an Exhibition Modes. Then you have Endless.In the carreer mode, you can upgrade your character by buying attributes, and equipment. Each piece of equipment has its benefits and its downgrades, letting you create your own sets for different situations. I didn't really like this, for the simple reason that it makes for a not as balanced game. If there were no upgrades, you would have to play like in the old days, memorizing patterns, and actually train to beat a game. In this, if you lose a couple of matches, you can just buy your way to victory, in a way. But... this is a different type of game, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining about that. It works for this game, letting the player create his own pacing in a way, and giving the game some customization, so I think it's good... even if I don't like the notion of it.In Tournament Mode, you have 4 leagues, each with 3 opponents. Each opponent has his own fighting style and backstory (which I enjoyed greatly, not swarming you with text, but letting their personalities go through small but to the point catch-phrases and fighting style, well done!). These get progressively harder, as one would imagine. You gain currency at the end of each fight, receiving a smaller amount when you lose.In Exhibition Mode, you can fight whoever you've fought before, for a smaller amount of currency. This was there in case the player was having difficulty defeating an opponent, then grinding a bit and upgrading his equipment/stats. I didn't really need that, but we'll get on to that further.Finally, in Endless Mode, you find in Rounds of just 1, trying to go through as many opponents as you can. As you fight, coins drop on the floor, which you can use in Carreer Mode, or to buy Health during the Endless Mode, as you don't gain health after each round.I actually enjoyed the game's structure quite a lot! Although, it was pretty short for me. Either way, for 5\u20ac, it was enough... and a lot of fun.Now, the most important part of the game: the combat.I have several issues with it. But, it was fun as hell while it lasted! And it's deeper than it seems when you start playing.You can do Jabs (left-handed fast, but weak punches), Crosses (slightly slower but stronger right-handed punches), Uppercuts, and Hooks as attacks. Your objective is to figure out which ones work the best against the different opponents, and then doing combos with these. The great thing is that opponents start defending against your combos if you use always the same, so it pushes the player to experiment with different tactics.And defense, you can Block, and you can walk Sideways (this walking sideways is my biggest complain, instead of a dodge ability). When you Block, you still lose HP, but a smaller amount, and you can lower that by upgrading a certain attribute.Each fighter has HP and Power (which is essentially a Stamina Bar). Whenever you attack, or Block, you lose Power. If you use it all, you'll get very, very slow, and won't be able to attack nor block appropriately. This makes the player be a bit more careful when to attack and block, creating a good pacing to the fights. However, the slowing part of running out of energy, is often not being able to escape attacks fast enough, even by walking sideways. That sometimes got awkward and frustrating during a couple of fights, but it's a question of being careful when managing attack and defense.In regards to HP, you have a general bar, you have one that depletes faster, but also regenerates. This creates an awesome dynamic in combos: the bigger the combo, the more impact it may have. You can finish the fights really quickly if you combo your attacks wisely, but they can also end fast for you if not careful. When you're hit, this alternative bar lowers faster, but it regenerates up to a point when you're not being attacked. This was unexpected, but great design, well done!One big complaint I have with the combat, it the lack of connection. Due to the sideways walk and the animation, punches sometimes don't connect when they feel like they should. If you slightly to the left/right, you can still see the punches hit the opponent, but it doesn't register. This leads to some awkward moves and makes it almost feel unfair, but it's not so bad once you get the hang of it. Still, I don't like it and I think it should be reworked if the developers make a sequel.Achievements were mainly straightforward, but some were pretty creative, which I appreciate.Lack of multiplayer is a fault, in my opinion, since you can complete the game within 5-6hours without too much of an issue... but hey, it's 5\u20ac! And it's pretty good either way! Maybe more in a future game!Another thing was the difficulty... I started the game on Hard, and it actually was hard when I started. But once I got used to the controls and developped a tactic, the difficulty has fallen quite a bit. Then there was NewGame+ which was surprisingly easier, with no difficulty options this time. Only 3 fights gave me a fairly hard time (due to very strong punches), but other than that, it was very easy in the NG+.But, it was challenging at times.So, if you're curious about the game, I'd definitely recommend it. It has its flaws, but it was a very enjoyable, and at times challenging game. And it's not very expensive, so you wouldn't lose all that much for trying it!",

        "text": "I've first played Brutal Legend, and now Costume Quest. Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings.Costume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid! Essencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister. So, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way.That sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.The game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat. In combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks. Each costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them. There are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle.You have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.I didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow.To its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.Outside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests. There are quite a few \"secrets\" and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!Besides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat.The various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!The graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for.Music was up there as well, really enjoyed it!Most of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!So... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well.But that's my biggest complain with this game. Other than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.It looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively. It's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist!I'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!",

        "text": "This will not be a very detailed and informative review.I had heard a buzz on this game and, despite not really being my thing, I've decided to try it out.It showed a few interesting concepts, whcih may have been cool to play with. Also, being a satire, it might have been a funny experience! ...Well, it's not. At least it wasn't for me.The satirical aspect of it was very minimal and superficial, I felt, using the same aspect of it way too much, making it old very, very fast.Also, despite there being an end-game objective, nothing really points to what it might be, or what you should do to escape and then win the game. Barely even after you lose... which simply shows a game over screen.Overall, the game didn't present its objectives at all, which isn't all that great of an idea.Gameplay is simply clicking boxes and doing the same \"social\" tasks over and over... and over again. For the whole game. You essentially have different activities that increase/decrease interests, health, happiness, various skills, etc. which will be used in your career (in different jobs), relationships, etc.This could have been good, but it's simply laborious to do it. You click the same boxes dozens of times, managing relationships isn't at all interesting or fun... There is no character to the different people of meet, it's... not very good, really.Also, each run's length it way too high, boring the player out of the same playthrough.From what I've seen, there's only one random event, which makes it really boring. It just kills people randomly (I may or may not have had 2 girlfriends killed on those) and didn't seem to serve any practical purpose.So, gameplay is very bland, repetitive leading to a boring experience, in my opinion.What about the satirical aspect?Well, everyone is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 moron. A superficial, self-centered, arrogant moron. That's it. That's the game's society and apparent satire. People only care about Likes, Relationships and their Rank. Every person I've met in the game seemed the same, and wasn't interesting at all. I don't know how someone could have thought this would be nice to play, to be honest.Well, I've also found a couple of bugs, but nothing too serious.The interface wasn't very intuitive, sometimes even objectively bad, leading the player to misclick too often (specially in the missions section).So, if you're interested in the game and have experience in similar games, maybe you'll have a different opinion than mine. Maybe there are aspects to this game that I simply \"don't get\". That's fine, but do it at your own risk.To anyone else... this is a very shallow experience, taking a fairly interesting concept, and making it more boring than social media itself (which is a feat, let's be honest).I'm sorry for such a negative review, but this provided my with no joy at all. I might've done several playthroughs to see if it had any depth, but I had enough from the first try... Pass on this one.",

        "text": "Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a pong... reimagination... reimagination. Sounds weird, right? Well, it took the old Shufflepuck Cafe, and it has modernized it. With fancy graphics, more opponents, upgrades, backstory for characters, concept art, ... you name it. It has a bunch of stuff! It's also an iOS port. A very poor one at that. I'll say right off the bat: I didn't dislike the general feeling of the game and gameplay itself. That was pretty good, for what it is. But... it's Pong. And it's a really bad port of Pong. I'll get on to why.This was a free game on iOS, with a bunch of IAPs. The computer version has no IAPs, as one would imagine, since it costs 10\u20ac. That doesn't mean, however, that the grind is gone. Oh no, no no! If you want something on this game, you'll have to play the same opponent and mode over and over again. I liked the game when I started playing, but it quickly went downhill into a grindfest. That's really unfortunate... and lazy. Graphics look nice. It's not something spectacular, but, for what is is, it looks pretty good. And it delivers its objective, so that's a plus!The music was also pretty cool. It invoked the feeling of the old Shufflepuck, and even Star Wars and Cowboy Bebop in conjunction with the visuals! That was pretty awesome. But the music gets old after a few hours, since you have a looping song per floor. The old Shufflepuck Cafe didn't have much of a backstory told to the player. It was up to imagination. Shufflepuck Cantine Deluxe delivers that backstory for you in very (very) detailed Biographies for each opponent, that you can buy with hard earned in-game currency. That sounds cool, but it's just text. One would have to interrupt the game for a while to read it all. So... It's a cool idea, but I don't like the way it was implemented. They could've voice-acted it after each mini-quest or so... Well, it's too much text that breaks the pacing... if it has any.Let's talk about the gameplay itself.You all know Pong. In here, you can have different discs, each with different special powers to give it different tragectories (and so do you opponents), and you can have different Mallets, and upgrade them to get more in-game currency (credits).This provides a little bit of variety, but it the end, they didn't take it very far, and their effects on the game are far lesser than they could have been.In the game, you have 3 modes: Duel, in which the one to hit x number of points first, wins. Then you have Bets, in which you pay some money, and get more back if you win. Then you have Survival, in which you'll play until you suffer a hit.Duel gives you medals depending on how many point your suffer. Has you unlock those, for each character, you'll be given mini-quests, during which you'll just fighter other opponents with different mallets. It gets very repetitive. VERY repetetitive.Then you have floors, with 3 different opponents in each one. These get progressively harder, but it's nothing too challenging. The problem is, apart from the different special powers, it's always the same game. You're always doing the exact same thing. And the way they've structured the game, was for you to play for about 20 hours (at least) before you're able to go to the final floor, after unlocking everything.Unless you're a really, really big fan of pong or the old Shufflepuck Cafe, there's no point. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, specially on a PC.Why would one play this on a PC, really? And for so long, for that matter. I was going to finish it, but after 9 hours I was just sick of it. It brought nothing new to the table, no surprises, no challenge, no nothing!Now, about the Port. First off, they have 2 separate settings menus. Why the...? Why would you do that? Why not take everything to the same place? Ah well...In regards to audio, there's only Music and SFX. On or Off. No sliders... When to developers learn?Graphics options are very, very poor as well, barely has anything. Gameplay has essentially the mallet velocity and very few else. It's just a very very lackluster port. And even worse, they kept the design as it was for mobile devices. That's \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 awful. It's just a time waster, and it's very unfortunate.Gameplay was genuinely good, if not repetitive. But... they've ruined everything by not caring about the overall experience and just following the trend to milk money off their consumers. And, if not money, then time. And not changing that when they made a PC port is just very lazy. This was just a cash-in and it should in no way be on Steam.If you like this type of game, go ahead and get it. But beware, its pacing and structure is as awful as it gets.For anyone else... No, I would not recommend this at all. At least not until the game has been reworked for PC.",

        "text": "Having finished Fear 2, I was wanting more. That game had its issues, but its atmosphere carried it, and it was a great experience overall.Since I had Fear 3, I decidede to give it a try. Well, having finished one playthrough in Fearless difficulty, I can see I was a bit disappointed. BUT, it's not a bad game. Not a bad game at all... just not a very good Fear, in my opinion.This game feels a lot like a modern shooter, without the creepy atmosphere. Besides, there really isn't a very coherent place in which you play. Each level is a different location. While that does provide variety, it doesn't feel very good to just jump from place to place just because. It makes it feel more like an amusement park... Besides, these places don't feel scary anymore. You're not as much is hostile territory anymore, and that was the biggest disappointment.Atmosphere has gone down the drain. For some reason, for the developers, blood everywhere=horror. All there is to it is bloody patterns everywhere, and red candles. These are in almost every level and don't really make much sense. Aside from these candles and blood, there is trash everywhere... even places that make no sense for it to be there. I... I don't know why they'd do this. They went more for the visual component of the environment rather than creating a good, dark atmosphere. It feels very artificial in Fear 3.The supermarket level has some cool places, I'll give them that. And the last level was enjoyable as well. Other than that... meh.The shooting feels better. I'd say gunplay has been improved, and it feels great to shoot human enemies and watch them fall apart. Weapon variety is essentially the same has in the previous game, without alternate firing modes.The new regenerating Health System is a big, big disappointment. Why did they do it? One of the best things in the previous game was exploring for health and armour, and feeling cautious when you had none. This time around, there's no point. If you're low on health, just hide behind cover for a couple of seconds. Another aspect which feels like a modern shooter rather than a Fear game.The mech control was also pretty good.Enemy variety is questionable, and just boils down to a completely average shooter with 2 or 3 additional mini-boss style enemies.Difficulty was fairly easy, with the exception of a couple of completely spikes. Nothing impossible, just pay attention to the environment and choose where to stand/hide and you'll be fine. It's just a shame that it was a bit incoherent in this aspect. Nothing too bad.Visually, it's significantly better than the previous game. Despite being a pretty poor port, that was patched and problem should be solved without too much of an issue. The textures were very blurry, but it wasn't too noticeable unless you were actively looking at them. Lighting effects were really good, I'll give them that. They've used the shadows to enhance atmosphere a bit but it was definitely not enough to carry it. Still, credits where its due, good job on the lighting effects.Animation quality was spot on as well, I'd say, as were the cutscenes. Particle effects were dubious at times, but there were pretty good overall.The music was another aspect that pushed the atmosphere down. Most of the music was very action oriented, taking Fear out of the game. Sound effects weren't nothing to write home about, but nothing too bad. They did the job. Except for Alma's screams. Those were pretty bad, in my opinion.There was no horror in this game, unfortunately. All the scares were jumpscares. And they weren't all that scary, really. Some were good, most were barely noticeable. It's a real shame. They've completely ruined the atmosphere of the game. They've opted for the easy way out, making a modern shooter instead of a Fear game. Environment was based around blood everywhere. Just... blood and symbols. It didn't really feel hostile towards you, and that might be the reason why it didn't feel scary at all.Story was pretty straightforward. Alma's in pregnant (play the last game) and her other 2 sons go after her to do something about it. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 happens on the way and half of the city is destroyed. Nothing spectacular, although I did like the ending. Still, nothing that'll get you thinking. It's just an excuse to shoot everything.Collectibles and Achievements... Argh, these were awful. Really awful. Collectibles do absolutely nothing for the player. Except for achievements. But... well, why would one do it? In the last game, you would explore for Intel, which gave you insight on the backstory. This time, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing, and I hate it. They've dumbed down everything that made Fear, Fear! You collect stuff for the sake of it. No context, no reward.Absolutely pointless, and it makes me mad.Besides, there are \"challenges\" in each level, which simply pushes the player towards a playstyle that isn't necessarily the most fun. It's just about getting x kills with each weapon, hide behind cover for x time, etc. etc.It's not there to improve gameplay in any way, so it might has well not be there, to be honest. Overall impressions. This was a pretty negative review, I realize it. But it's not a bad game. The gameplay feels good, it looks and sounds good... but it has barely anything to do with Fear. It's just another shooter now... maybe a bit more gory, but that's it.And that's definitely not what I was looking for.So, if you're looking for a brainless shooter, go ahead and play this.If you're looking for a well crafted game, with a great atmosphere... look somewhere else.It's a good game. Just not a good Fear game. ",

        "text": "This game has enough reviews already taken its age. So I'll just say this: it's a hell of a game! ... most of the time.I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of it. It had a nice pacing, alternating between an hostile and creepy atmosphere and a normal fps.That last 1/4 of it was... more of an on-rails fps, unfortunately. Very few \"horror-ish\" scenes, which made for a more generic experience. Also, the difficulty spiked, becoming far harder out of nowhere.But, it was definitely worth it for the rest of the game. The designers knew how to get the player uncomfortable, in a very good way. There were memorable situations. There were a few jumpscares, but they were well placed, so that's not an issue.It's not a very scary game, but it had its moments. Quality over quantity. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a creepier fps. But, it falls for some of the modern shooter trappings closer to the ending, unfortunately.Also, sound and visual design was great! This game still looks good, and sounds even better, even after 5 years.",

        "text": "I had my eye on this game for a few months now, and when I saw it in a bundle, I decided to try it out. It was a surprisingly good overall, although it has some serious issues that deters a lot from the experience.Megabyte Punch is an arcad-y brawler with a fairly high focus on customization. The combat is very much alike Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which is nice to see on a pc. Essentially, you go around several levels, with 3 stages each, with a Boss as a final stage. Each level has its own looks and theme to it which is good for variety. Each time you lose all your lives (which you can get from collecting Bytes, the game's currency), or you finish a level, you get back to the village, the game's \"Hub\" area.  There, you can go around talking to different Megacs getting a few tips on the game, or go to a store and buy new parts, and then go into another level, which you unlock as you go further into the game.Graphics.As you can see from the steam screenshots, the game is really great looking! It has a very unique artstyle, and manages to invoke some retro feel while looking very sharp and modern. That's a really nice feature of the game. There's not much else to be said about them. Everything seems to fit pretty well, it's a great 2.5D looking game!Sound.Also, the music is really awesome! Surprisingly so, actually. And music also changes according to the level your in, each fitting the setting as best as possible. There's a level in a desert, with pyramids on the background, and with an oriental sounding track. You get the drill. SoundEffects were pretty good as well, giving the combat a good impact after you've done some good damage. More on that further.Customization.So, in Megabyte Punch, you control a Megac, with several different parts you can attach to it, each giving a different Stat or Ability, and changing how the character looks. This actually reminded me of Medabots quite a lot, and it was a great throwback to my childhood. That's always a plus!There are 150 parts in total, which you can get through the levels or the Tournament Mode (more on that later). Although there are many parts, some of them have the same effects. Or at least, the same description, since there aren't all that many numerical information about them. That's actually pretty bad, in my opinion. There are parts that simply \"increase damage\". But there's no actual information about its differences. If the only difference is the look of them, it's kind of pointless to have those in, isn't it?Ah well, overall, customization wasn't bad, but there is much room for improvement, to be honest.Combat.So, this is probably one of the most important components of this game. Unfortunately, it does not feel as well and it should, most of the time. The biggest issue I had with it was the knockback. If you're familiar with SSBB's combat, you know that as the opponent gets more and more damaged, the impact rises until he flies into a wall and explodes. Well, it's the same here. BUT, the first hits simply throw the opponent away enough so that it's hard for you to hit him a second time, as a follow up. That leads to Punch-step-punch-step-punch... etc. This makes the combat very sloppy, and not that fluid. It makes it harder to combo moves, and it leads to imense frustration when the opponent is hit, and then attack you right away to the ridiculous knockback. Also, (note that I was playing with a Gamepad), using different abilities is sometimes very clucky, since you have to press a direction to activate an ability, and then quickly press the direction in which you'll you use it. This leads to the player using the wrong abilities all the time, or just wrong directions. So, overall, I wasn't too pleased with the combat, leading to a frustrating experience that could have easily been polished.Tournament Mode.This is essentially a classic SSBB mode, in which you fight other Megacs, or Bosses, individually. It's pretty cool, but it gets old a bit too quickly on your own.Which leads to another big problem. Local Multiplayer Coop only. Sorry, I had to mention it. Since there's no online play, a big part of this game is simply left to dust in a pc game. It's a shame, it could've been a much better game for it.Finally, my biggest problem with the game. This got on my nerves way too much. The checkpoint system. I don't understand why the developers thought this was good at all. Well... it's awful, sorry.Everytime you lose your lives, you get back to the Hub Area. But, that area is pretty big, which makes the player walk for a few minutes before getting back to a level. On top of that, if you were on stage 3 when you died, you'll have to go through the first and second stages again. What the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665?! Why would there be several stages if there are no checkpoint systems? This leads to too much time lost everytime you die and, again, frustration. The only real Checkpoint is before a Boss. Well, at least there was that. But it's definitely NOT enough. \"Oh, you were just bad at the game\". Yeah... Look at Super Meat Boy. A game has to make \"dying fun\", in a sense. It's alright if one dies, as long a he can get into the game right away and try again. Without having to deal with walking to the level over and over again, and then redo a lot of previously beaten sections. You'll be bored to death before getting to the challenging part. Aaaand that leads to the final Boss.That was really, really awful. First, it starts with a normal Megac fight. Fair enough. It was challenging, but nothing to hard. Once you're done with it (which takes a while), you get 2 lives and advance to a second Boss Fight. I'll not that there is NO CHECKPOINT after this, which means that you ALWAYS have to beat the first stage before moving. But, the second part of the Boss has 4 stages. And the first 2 are essentially the same as the last 2. Which is really dreadful design. This leads to a very long fight, which gets far longer whenever you die, having you go through it over and over again. With the clunky combat system and the awful checkpoint system, this leads to a very bad experience, in my opinion. It's a shame, but this last impression pushed this game down a lot in my consideration.Conclusion.It's unfortunate, the starts starts off stellarly, but then reveals its flaws further into it. It's an overall great game, but its design flaws hurt it a lot, with long levels without checkpoints (which makes you be stuck in the game for longer than you should), and a huge wait time between deaths.Plus, no Online Multiplayer.Still, it's great going through the levels, it looks and sounds great, and it invokes a great feel from 90s games and TV shows.Experimentation with the different parts and combat styles is also pretty good!Cheers.",

        "text": "First off, I'd like to say that I had a mildly enjoyable time playing this game in the first couple of hours. It's not all bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good game. RAW is a game that doesn't do anything very well. It's mostly generic, with no inovation whatsoever, and then with a subpar combat due to being designed for consoles.Combat and Controls.The most important thing in a game like this should be the combat. I've finished the game with the Mage class, and it feels very \"spammy\", since you click to launch a fireball, and that's your main attack. The Skill Trees are simple enough, having 3 tiers from which you can level up abilities and get some new ones. The bad thing here is that half of them are useless, and the upgrades are very straightforward, none of them being out of ordinary.Another big problem with it is that you only have 2 mouse button, plus 1-4 for abilities, 3 and 4 being necessarily your potion slots. You can hit TAB to switch to an alternative 1-4 set of abilities, but it's just a pain in the ass to do so in the middle of combat. Seriously, why the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 would you port a game to a PC and not change that? How hard can it be?! It just demonstrates laziness from the developers, imo. The Difficulty is also too easy. Far too easy. I've played this game in Heroic Mode and I've barely died. And when I died, it was because I was very much distracted (Yes, since the combat is mostly pressing LMB, you lose focus pretty easily). Also, the \"difficulty\" only comes from swarming you with enemies that appear out of nowhere, and their attacks can stun you for a second.  On the other hand, they also died very easily, providing no challenge. The big mobs, Bosses, if you will... are the easiest. They're big and slow, make it very easy to dodge their attacks and just knock them back as soon as they get close to you.Enemy variety is close to non-existent. There are like 2 melee units, one faster than the other, then there is a ranged unit, and then there are spiders. Lots of those. Every enemy is essentially a reskin of the mentioned. Mini Bosses are pretty much larger versions of those enemies, far slower and with more HP. None of them has any noteworthy ability, it's just dodging projectiles, and killing enemies from afar.Graphics.This game looks okay. Nothing that blew me away, but it looks pretty good nonetheless, even if rough around the edges. For the first half of the game, you're traveling through different places which gives a good variety to the levels. On the second part of the game, you're going through the same kind of places, which gets a bit tedious, close to the end.An important issue I had with the graphics, is that the enemies are always the same color as the background. Why the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665...?! How could they not see that? In every level, you can't even see most enemies very well due to all the colors being very similar. This is just bad design and I have no explanation for why they'd do it.In regards to effects, they're generally good enough, with the exception of the Fireball, which looks pretty bland.Animation quality is service-able, it's not bad, but it's not stellar either.Sound.Sound effects were also pretty bland, nothing noteworthy here. The music fits the setting, but, again, nothing to write home about. This feels more of an arcade game rather than an ARPG.Level Design.Despite their visual variety in the first half of the game, there's nothing unforgettable here. Levels are quite short, and have nothing interesting. Nothing to tell the world's story, other than \"everything is mad at you and will attack you\". Except for vendors, who are not attack.. for some reason. Later in the game, there are a couple of different levels, more of an arena and labyrinths, but they're like 2 or 3 levels. Out of the 26 available.There was room for much more here... Side quests are very uninteresting as well, and require almost no sidetracking. Mostly \"Get this random package to this point ahead in the level\", or \"Kill this bad guy\".ALSO, no map! Seriously? Why? This makes no sense. It's not that one would get lost all that much, but it would be helpful to keep track of where the player is, and what's left to explore. AND, at one point, part of the main quest is to slay monsters in West, SouthWest and NorthWest. Fair enough. The problem is, there are no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 directions. No map, no compass, no direction indicator. And South isn't just down. West was Down and to the Right. There's no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 reason for that to be west. And that kind of pissed me off. That just makes no sense, and was a piece of very bad design in my opinion.Achievements. Uh. Why would one review achievements? Well, I believe that achievements can help the player try out new things, explore a bit more and discover interesting things in the mechanics or the world. Well, not here. Achievement are very generic as well, so... yeah. They might as well not be here. Conclusion.Unfortunately, this game doesn't really do anything very well. It does some things pretty badly. But it's not something I'm mad that it exists. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you really like this type of games.I took some enjoyment out of it, it's not all bad, but there's sooooo much that need to be reworked here... Well, maybe the next game will be better. And please, do not make it all console-like again if you're porting it to the PC. That might have been the cause of most of its problems. Cheers. ",

        "text": "Jump to the end for a quick conclusion.This is a hard one to review. Really Big Sky is a twin stick shooter, a bit bullet-hell-ish at times with.I really enjoyed the first couple of hours I played it, but it soon revealed itself. There are several thing I really like about this game, but their implementation leaves a lot to be desired, specially from a balance standpoint.I'll start with the pros of Really Big Sky:-It looks great! Even from the screenshots you can see that, but it looks much prettier in motion. There are a few resolution issues, but I was running it at 720p and it looked pretty good. I used this game has a pause between work, so playing in a smaller window didn't realy bother me.-Several modes. There is a classic mode, which includes bosses, events, scores, and shop in which you buy upgrades. There are modes that focus on difficulty, not attacking, giving a retro feel to the game, for just relaxing without worrying about scores and dying etc. So, there is choice, that's a plus.-Shop in the Classic mode let's you upgrade the parts you prefer and give you a sense of progression (which is also one of its faults)-Very detailed information. Everytime you end a run you get a score screen with more entries than anyone needs, really. And also a comparation to your average run, having the player strive to get better. Besides, there's a library with information about modes, events, bosses, upgrades, and so on. That's good, although it's way too detailed, and I doubt that anyone would go out of their way to read it all. I think that showing the entries as tips throughout loading screens would be more useful.-Bosses respect certain patterns, which change according to difficulty.-Decent variety in enemies, events and locations.-The music was pretty good. Not really my cup-of-tea, but I see some people really enjoying. Plus, it fit the context of the game.Now, the problems I have with it, some of them inherent with the pros' bad implementation, in my opinion:-The visuals are full of particle effects and filter changes, which can get a mess too often. Between those changes, you'll often lose track of what is on the screen, and what damages you or not. Most of the times, you'll die from something you didn't see. Also, it has performance issues later in the game, where particle effects are too many. I have a GTX660Ti and a 3.4GHz Quad Core... and it dropped to 5 fps at one time. That's pretty bad. But it ran mostly well on it. Still a reason to beware.-Bugs. Well, everytime I quit the game it crashed. That's not a big deal. Everytime I tried to see the Scores (as this is mostly as arcade game), it crashed. That's a problem now. And highly diminished the game's value. If there is no one to beat, why would I play more of it, after a while? Score attack games are fueled by.. well, score. This game has it broken. There are also a lot of people who can't get the game to run.-Dificulty Curve and balance. This is the worse part of the game. In the beginning, you're essentially running on trial and error, dying over and over until you learn how to get through certain things. But that's ok, learning the patterns and so on. But, as you progress through the game, it just gets a blurred mess in which there is no skill, and your score is mainly dependent on what you buy from the shop. And luck with the events you get. It's more of a grind-fest than struggling to get better at the game, since all you do after a while is to upgrade the ship and hope that the screen doesn't get too crumped with enemies and filters.-All the modes are too similar to increase the game's longevity too much. There's no drive to really play them, since most don't change too much about the game. The big one being Pacifist, in which you can't shoot, only dodge.=====================================================================So, conclusion.This is a game that is pretty, although relying entirely on particle effects and filter to achieve so, which often gets very messy.Progression is through grind and trial and error rather than skill, which isn't very good either.BUT, what I've played of it, was pretty enjoyable. The game feels good, for 3-3.5 hours. After that, with scores broken, it loses momentum and gets grindy and repetitive.If you're looking for a shoot-em-up to play for a few hours, this will be fun. If you're looking for a game to last you, or just a very good game... pass this one up. It's full of flaws and bad implementation, despite being a fun and well thought game in its core.I have to say, it feels satisfying whenever you score in the millions, but you also realize that it was more luck than skill. It is a fun game, sometimes, but I can't think of it as a good game.It seems to follow Boss Baddie's games' trend. Really neat concept, nice art direction (although too many annyoing effects), but then those games try to be bigger than they are with too many badly implemented mechanics.Please, keep it simpler. And polish them a bit more after release.I understand that other projects and games are more important than old ones, but several things are simply broken, and there are people paying for it.Cheers!",

        "text": "Well, I tried. Throughout my play of this game, I ran into several design flaws, but I kept going, to see where the concept was taken, seeing its potential. Well, after 3 long, long hours, I simply quit. The game claims it's about exploration, and aiding mysterious characters, but there's barely any of it. You arrive on the world and nothing is told to you. And that could be fine. But it simply keeps that way for the rest of the game. Nothing is told to the player, not even indirectly. I usually enjoy exploration games a lot, since they keep throwing little clues at the player, little pieces of the overall puzzle. But not here. I've forced myself to play it through, to see if anything changed, but barely anything did. The puzzles are senseless. They could make a bit more sense, if there were references to them throughout the game, that one could get through exploration.Since there's nothing, this game is about trial a error. Constantly. And it's simply not fun.You're not exploring anything. The map is just a labyrinthic mess, with fake walls that you can't tell from a normal wall. So, the only thing left to do, is roam around the world. Which has nothing special. It barely has any landmarks that could tell something interesting. There's nothing. The world feels as dead as it could. The characters are simply there for you to have a very vague idea of what to do to progress in the game, but they don't actually feel like characters. Only a chore board. The controls aren't anything to write home about either. And, on top of it, it tries to be a hard platformer. And it falls flat on its face. With these imprecise controls, you actually have to land on the tips of triangles. Seriously? Who could've thought this was a good idea? Then, a dark block with hidden paths inside. There's no way to see where you're going. Again, HOW could someone think this was a good idea? It's just frustrating trial and error. And it adds absolutely nothing positive to the game.The visuals did look unique, but you'd better turn off the post processing effects. Those are really, really bad. They simply blur your vision and end up hurting your eyes.The redeeming factor is this may be the music (althought not sound design). The music was really enjoyable, although it didn't quite play into the atmosphere of the game. Simply good, random, background music.I'm sorry if I'm being overly negative, but I had certain expectations for this, the idea seemed right up my alley. But... no. It's simply a badly designed game.In exploration games, you should learn something about the world. The world should have a story to tell. Something. But there's nothing here. I took no satisfaction from playing this after the first half hour or so.Plus, don't make it frustrating as it is. The controls aren't tight enough for it to try to be Super Meat Boy. The visual effects are way too exagerated. The map has no landmarks, it's simply labyrinthic, with \"secrets\" areas that make no sense.Too many ideas that were badly implemented. My advice would be to polish each aspect of the game a lot before trying to get it all together. Otherwise you get this. And it's not very good.Don't pick this one up.With that said, I'll still keep an eye out for Boss Baddie, these games might actually get pretty good after a lot of work has been put into them.",

        "text": "Here's a 2D Indie game that is most likely nothing like anything you've ever played. In a great way, I must add!In Waking Mars you're an explorer of Mars' caves and its newfound life. As you interact with more and more life, the game registers your findings in a log, showing the amount of work that has been put into designing everything about this game. Every piece of life is highly detailed, and it's worth reading the information you gather as you play.BUT this isn't a merely exploratory game, despite that being a big focus. After you learn about the life you encounter, you learn how to use it to your advantage, creating the most aproppriate habitat for a certain type of plant or animal to live. In doing so, they'll eventually interact with each other, prospering further and further, that being the main mechanic of this game. Each room has a certain Biomass level requirement for you to progress, a mechanic that makes sense in the context of this game , as the caves' natural defense is to block the exits until there's self-sustainable life in it.The story was there merely to guide you through your adventure deeper and deeper into Mars, giving you a helping hand in this journey.As you progress, you start grasping the game's mechanics, and you'll be able to create some pretty cool environments and interactions with everything at your disposal, which feels very satisfying. So, I'd advise anyone to definitely try out this game. The sense of discovery is present at all times, keeping you emersed in the world from start to finish. There's a constant drive to keep you moving forward and exploring more and that's a really big plus! The game's world and mechanics fit perfecty, which is fairly rare, so yea, give them your money already and... enjoy!",

        "text": "Update: Third time playing through the game, this time in preparation for Clash: Artifacts of Chaos.There's a lot more to the story and backstory compared to the first game. The plot is indeed a bit convoluted, but it's cool. And, in the process, you learn a lot about the larger world, beyond Zenozoik, and how Zenozoik came to existence. Also cool theme around tradition, feud-law vs. \"civilized\" law, authority, etc.; the writing is also a lot better this time around, with some really neat phrasings of core ideas.Gameplay, as I wrote earlier, is similar to the first game's, but there are more combos and weapons. The biggest flaw, in my view, is the encounter design itself. Fights involve a lot more people, this time around, so parrying and dodging aren't nearly as important. Everything is more chaotic, which works against the combat system, imo.In particular, one-on-one fights like the second Bounty Hunter in the first game are gone. The \"heavyweights\" are also just normal characters, now.It's not a huge problem for me, since the world is *the* reason to play the game. The areas are more or less the same as in the first game, with a few additions, but I really enjoyed going through them with the extra polish and generally updated tech. The game looks amazing and exotic. The levels themselves are also more open, full of little things to discover. Most of the time, they're inconsequential, but they still provide some enjoyment just by having \"something to look for around the corner\".Last time the music didn't stand out, but this time I loved it. It's never really in the foreground, but it is cool, with nice texture (due to the instrumentation).___I was worried from the first impressions that people on youtube had about this game. Having really enjoyed the first one, I was really excited with a sequel's potential, and yet, the general opinion was that this was a far less enjoyable game than the first Zeno Clash. Regardless, since I had the game, I decided to try to right after finishing the first.So, let's say it has a pretty confusing and \"not as exciting as I hoped for\" beginning. Even having played the first one, this game throws you into the wolves right from the start in regards to its story, and that sort of continued through the rest of the game... That's my biggest complain. There's a string of events between the first Zeno Clash and this one that they simply don't tell you. In the first one, Golem helps you through the journey and everything seems fine in the end. When this game starts, Ghat's feelings towards the Golem have changed entirely, which puts you in a weird position of not knowing why exactly that has happened.But I'll go into that later.The main focus of the last game, was the world they've built, which was weird as hell, but also beautiful in its own way, despite not having the opportunity to explore its full potential. I'm satisfied to say that the said issue has *mostly* been resolved with Zeno Clash II. You'll meet many more characters that give you more pieces towards understanding the world, and have many more different areas to roam around.This time, however (and much to my sadness), the Corwids weren't given as much atention has in the last game, although there's some contact with them as well (read my impressions of the first Zeno Clash if you don't know what they are).The scale of their world and story is far more grandiose in this game. Instead of worrying about your little world, doorways are opened into a larger world than zenozoik. You'll be able to understand the origins of this \"tribe\", and that was a great drive for me, the whole way through. From the first game, you learned the world. This time, you learned how that world came to be, and that's pretty awesome.My advice for playing the game: look for every Cube, and then go into the Secret Tunnels in the desert (do it towards the end). Also, find it by yourself, it's not too hard, and it's a great part about the world discovery! In that tomb you'll find more information that complement what you learn through the story nicely.So, the world is still great, if not greater. What else? Characters!This time, you'll meet other beings similar to Golem, you'll know their purpose, their origins, and to a point, their deep characters. My main problem, as I said, was the main character, Ghat. At least for me, a Player vs. Player-Character conflict arose for me. (read more about it here http://thestorymechanics.com/2013/09/03/player-vs-player-character/)My own beliefs through playing the game were in a constant conflict with the actions that the game had me do. Those beliefs came to be from what I played in the first game... I came to play a certain Ghat that is incoherent with the actual Ghat, and that was a bit awkward, and something the designers should be more careful with next time around. This may very well be a personal problem, but it contributed to my initial confusion, and detriment of the experience in the first hour or so. Apart from that, the characters were as great, this time with a focus on Golems instead of Corwids, both unique and great to the world of ZenoClash.So, the world and the characters have once again carried the game for me, and I loved it the whole way through. If you've enjoyed the first game, you definitely have to try this out, since the same aspects that made the first a great game, make this an even better game, since it has improved its flaws with a richer and more open world.The combat system was fairly the same, with more combos, and a bit of Cooperative play, but not too much to make a big difference. It does not hinder the game, and it's a nice change of pace from most FPSs out there.You still have primitive weapons which look great, although they're not really a necessity to go through the game.Final thoughts: The art direction was still awesome, creating a really rich world (both visually and conceptually), with its own backstory and look to it. The music didn't really standout for me, but it's not a major issue in any way.If you haven't played the first Zeno Clash, go play it, and then play this. They're both very much worth your time if you enjoy having a completely different world to explore and great characters to talk to.",

        "text": "First of all, I'll say that I didn't really enjoy this game. But I can appreciate the effort that was put into it, and I must say that the final product couldn't be much better than it is, I'd say. But it's not my kind of game.If your familiar with Amanita's games, you'll know this already, but the highly stylized world and characters is their main focus. Like its predecessors, it's a point n' click game, and it has the same problems I have with nearly every game in the genre: you simply click everything on the screen until something happens. And that's not fun for me. It doesn't matter how pretty the world is, that alone simply isn't enough to captivate me. On the other hand, if you enjoy these kinds of games, you'll most likely be amazed with this! The amount of detail put into the \"bugs/creatures\" and the environments is mesmerizing, and I have to give them credit for that. Amanita Design strikes again!It's a shame that they always do point n' click games. I'm always impressed with their world design and charming way of memorably presenting simple stories... But the gameplay really lacks, with the amount of downtime there is between traversing from a screen to another.Also, level design was a bit too labyrinthic in levels 2 and 3, having huge areas for the player to go back and forth to get different objects to progress. That's something that wouldn't be as bad if there was something to the gameplay other than clicking an edge of the screen and waiting for the little guys to walk there.Aside from the traditional gameplay, there are some animated scenes, which are really great, one even representing how the \"Amanita Universe\" was created, with the Big Bang and both Samorost and Machinarium worlds forming. I feel like I would have enjoyed \"seeing\" a let's play of this game, rather than playing. They've scored everything in this, except for the gameplay.The soundtrack fits the game's aesthetic very well, so I simply can't have any complaints about its presentation, it's amazing.So, if you like point n' click games, go ahead, you'll have a blast! Otherwise, don't expect this to change your mind.",

        "text": "Original review at the bottom. Only wanted to add: game design is very bad. I mean, you're sent to a new area, get some dialogue, they throw 5-15 enemies at you, give you some weapons, maybe, and off you go. The whole game is basically like this.So it's not very inspired, in the actual game.But the world is so unique that you should try it. It's reminiscent of Moebius, presenting a colorful, alien world which more often than not leaves things unexplained. This time around, I'm also doing the tower challenges. The towers has a cool visual design. The challenges themselves are just more fighting, but they're certainly more varied. A bit frustrating, since they're mostly about endurance and consistency. It's not a very short but very difficult challenge like a Super Meat Boy level.Instead, you have 5 \"floors\" in each challenge, each one providing a fairly challenging fight. In 5 of the challenges you heal between each floor about half of your total HP. On the 3, you don't heal at all, except some consumables you find.They're fairly difficult, but not too difficult, most of the time.They do highlight some of the combat system's clunkiness, however. Sometimes your attacks connect, visually, but the game doesn't detect, there are many timing details (regarding stamina, blocking, recovering from a hit, etc.) that are not very clear, and with little feedback. The problem, essentially, is that the main game isn't very well designed, and so doesn't teach you the subtleties of the fighting system. You don't need them at all to beat the game, since it's fairly easy and otherwise forgiving, so you can luck your way into the end. When confronted with it in the challenges, it can feel very clunky. Abyss Odyssey suffered from a similar problem - the game was heavily influenced by Smash Brothers, which has a very unique fighting system that seems incredibly stiff and clunky for newcomers, used to a more fluid system.Anyway, this game still holds a special place, for me. Everything in the world is unique, from the plants, to the creatures, to the houses. The game looks dated, now, but I'd love to see ACE team exploring this universe again, especially seeing how much more polished Rock of Ages 2 is, graphically!___________________________________Here's a game you should definitely try! It's both great and well... incredibly average, but it's satisfying from start to finish.This is a short game, you can easily complete it in about 3 hours. It's a kinda sloppy melee first-person brawler.  Its combat system isn't bad, but it gets clunky at times, specially in group fights. However, punching enemies into a 5 meter flight makes you feel like a badass. And the ragdoll physics on the corpses are a nice touch as well. I haven't played Zeno Clash 2 yet, but I will soon enough, and I assume the combat system has been polished since 2009, although I've heard it focus too much on team fights, which is where the clumsiness comes in... But I digress. The game shines in its world and characters, which are all really weird, but at the same time, charming. They present neat ideas that feel like they should have been much more explored and fleshed out, but everything seems experimental here, hence its length.For example: \"The Corwids are not slaves of reality, so they can be insane. Oxameter walks in a straight line without letting letting anything change his path... and that's what Oxameter does.\" There are other Corwids with interesting... \"features\", so I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're interested in them alone.Now, another problem I have, in regards to the exploration of the world, is that, since the game goes from one arena to the others, you barely have any time to explore the areas and take the time to appreciate the world they've created. While you're in combat, you'll be busy to look around, and the scenes end as soon and you beat everyone up. This still leaves you with an idea of what it is, but too vague for my liking. Again, I hope Zeno Clash II solves this \"issue\".Voice acting is pretty bad, but it's bearable, and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. The cutscenes follow the same route, with some cheesy animations, but again, that wasn't my reason to be playing the game, so it didn't really make much of a difference.So, for the conclusion. If you're interesting in world, creature and character design, this is definitely a must-buy. They've done a great job there, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  If you're coming for the combat system, or a grand scale story... well, you'll not find it here, not quite. Still, I'd encourage you to pick it up on a sale, since it's a very interesting game to play.Well, I'm off to play Zeno Clash II now, I'm definitely interested in what comes next. Cheers!",

        "text": "Home is a weird game. Don't be mistaken by its \"horror\" label, it's nothing of the sorts. Just a creepy atmosphere, but there's nothing horrifying about it (except what it may make you imagine, which is good). The premise in essentially that you're a man who wakes up in an unknown house...seemingly with amnesia. From there, you look for clues wherever you go, and according to what you look at, and even pick up, the game gives you clues about what may be happening. This is awesome! Seriously, it makes you change up your ideas during the whole game! Even if you have an idea about what might have happening, your next action might very well change it completely. Or it might strengthen it. This leads to a lot of replayability, and many different ways to interpret the same story.It's great! And yet, it's also pretty bad. Why, you ask? Its core ideas are really great, and, most of its execution is as well. However, due to the many, many branching paths, it sometimes get confused, and manages to screw it up a bit, mostly at the end.My big complain comes from the lack of a warning about the actions you can't undo. Some paths you take don't let you go back, and don't tell you that either, which leads to imense frustration when you're like \"Oh, I'll explore this room first, and then get back here...\" Well, no. Sometimes, it simply assumes you chose to progress with the game through that room, and it leaves you thinking about that one area you skipped, since you're unable to go back. And there is no save system, so you can't just go back, unless you want to play it again, doing everything in the same way, changing your pathing choice.This made my second playthrough very frustrating towards the end, specially since I chose not to read the very important clue and the end, to explore the rest of the house, and then go read it. But it simply didn't let me. And that completely ruined the ending for me, it really did. I'll have to go through it again, from the very beginning, which is NOT a bad thing, if you want to try something different. In this case, I'll have to go through it in the same way, merely changing the ending.This issue aside, my views on it are mostly positive. Its minimalist sound and graphic design work really well, and I love the way the story is presented, really great work. This is a game that even if it's short (about 1hour and a half for playthrough), it leads to a few playthroughs, which makes it very worth your 2\u20ac.I would have appreciated some music and not just ambient sounds, but it's not a big issue. Try it out! It will not disappoint you (mostly, since you might get frustrated if you \"miss\" the ending you were aiming for, but that is easily fixed with another playthrough).I'm certainly playing it at least a third time, maybe a fourth. Also, it gives interesting insight into game design and a different way to approach story telling, even if it needs some refining. Enough ranting now. Buy it, it's damn worth it.",

        "text": "Hmm, who would have thought something like this could work out so well? A game about a mother badger feeding and protecting her cubs from the dangerous wildnerness that constantly keeps you on your toes.The game consists of 5 levels, each one with a unique theme, the first being a sort of calmer, introductory level to teach players the mechanics of the game (feeding, hunting and hiding), quickly moving on to the scary Night time, an hostile environment that easily scares the cubs, having them running into the predator's den. Then, you'll deal with a rainny day, traversing through overflowing rivers that might just drown you if you're not careful, after that leading to a Fiery forest, trying to keep the flames at bay. All this while trying not to be caught by an eagle, the \"antagonist\" of this game (or is it?), concluding everything in the last level, a constant hide and seek between the two species.This was an unexpected game, with a unique graphic style, and very beautifully done! The game brings a feeling of persistent consequence everytime a cub is lost, since there is no going back after one has been killed. As a result, you're constantly on your toes, and, despite its limited length, it's totally worth the time and money. There's the possibility of multiple playthroughs, trying to save as many cubs as possible.Overall a very positive experience, which I'll go through at least once again to see how different it is after a good grasp of the  ways of surviving. I'd advise anyone looking for something different to play it.",

        "text": "Great little story right here! Despite a few limitations inherent to the engine, playing it for the \"feel\" of it as well as its story is totally worth it!The gameplay you'll find here is mostly really simple, more of a vehicle for the story to move forward, but it won't feel like a nuisance at all. It mostly gives you the freedom to explore a little bit more, despite that no being necessarily something you'll have to do, as most the information will be given to you as you go through it. Still, the small details on the world do make a difference, so it's nice that the exploration element is there.The intricate story is what shines here, and, as you progress, there are enough twists to keep you rethinking your initial \"predictions\" and constantly adding pieces to the whole puzzle of what's happening. One of the things I really like about its pacing is how well it adds little details that make all the difference later, and they're not too much of a stretch for anyone to catch.The characters are really well designed, I've got to say! Each of them has their very own personality and you end up feeling like you know them, and each conveys a very different feel to the scenes... Which is great in any game, but specially a story-driven one such as this!The ending is also great, within the range I was expecting, but different enough not to become predictable. So, overall, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for more of a story than a game. Great work, Kan Gao!",

        "text": "So, seeing that the game had been Greenlit and fairly well acclaimed, I thought I'd give it a try. The story was pretty promising, as someone who's into Mythology, and it game would revolve around it. So, le'ts get on with it! It's advertised as \"a story-driven game with emphasis on exploration, information gathering and also includes horror-survival elements\". Let's just get the \"horror-survival elements\" out of the way. It is in no way, a survival horror game, that must have been what they've stuck to it since every youtuber and their dog screamed whenever they stepped on a stick. They give you a flashlight. With batteries. Hmmm, surely, I must scavenge for more batteries after these are over. Well... not really. They feel like it's a good idea to give you an unlimited lantern, that lights waaaay more than the said \"essential\" flashlight. Seriously, if you're going to give us a better lighting tool, don't give us the flashlight at all, it makes no freaking sense! Oh, and I've only found one pack of flashlight batteries anyway, which, of course, I didn't use... it's pointless, really.Onwards to the \"exploration, information gathering\": Well, since the whole game is set at night, you can't really see much, which makes for a monotous walk through the forest, and that's your exploration. I'll admit I liked the artstyle, and the village, but there's virtually nothing to explore in the game. You have a semi open-world, but it's essentially a forest, and there's no point to explore on your own, since you'll go everywhere along with the story. I'd have loved to do some exploration, but there was no point, there was nothing to explore.\"story-driven\"... this one hurts, I'm sorry to say, but it really does. There's almost no story presented through gameplay... which, well, find it on youtube. As you go from place to place looking for items (I'll get there in a minute), there's no story to be told. Until you reach an house, that is, in which you'll get the feel for the story through some notes, and that alone. Almost every bit of story in this games, is given to you through text. It just feels out of place, and that text is always next to the item you need to progress the game, so there goes exploration, right? Look at Bioshock! The world itself tells the overall story, and those audiologs, just give us the background and some interesting details to complete the world. Now... the gameplay. This is essentially a First Person Point n' Click game! The puzzles are just \"Go there a get this, then come back and use that with this...\" and so on and so forth. And they feel like they're designed to extend the game's longevity, since you're constantly walking back and forth from one place to the one on the other edge of the map. And it's not fun. It's simply NOT fun... and neither is it scary, there's nothing scary about the game, unless you're afraid of the dark.I could say a lot about how senseless some \"puzzles\" were, but I feel like I'm going too hard at the game.The supposedly scary/stealthy part would be when you have to run from wolves (which appear out of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 nowhere whenever you pick a piece of the final puzzle) or from a patroling cultist. Aaaand it's awkward. Painfully so. Now, the only praise I can give to this game, is its looks, and the story potential (maybe?). To the developpers: if you're making a game and you CAN'T do something right, don't do it at all. Do something else. Because, what we get here, is a game that could be so much better than what it is, but it falls flat on its face because of badly implemented features!Maybe in future titles Nocturnal Nights will shine, and I'll give them another chance. It's just that this game in particular was really bad in my opinion. Full of bad design choices, seemingly to jump on the \"survival horror\" bandwagon that's been going on lately. ",

        "text": "I've been in a search of different \"games\", and so, this one intrigued me, specially since it didn't even advertise itself as a game, despite being release on Steam. So... if not a game, what is it? A \"Digital Adaptation\" is what it calls itself. It's essencially an adaptation of a book into a more visual format, with a little more interactivity. I've got to say, I'd rather read a book most of the time, than \"playing\" one, unless there's something to take from it that I wouldn't from a book. Well, in regards to that, this is a much shorter form of a book, focusing on the essential only, and at the same time, giving some additional insight into the story's time and world through journals and such, for those interested... and, again, not a game. I usually play games for more interactivity than this has given me, at specially choice and consequence, which is something that I can't really get from a book, and which this still doesn't provide. So, all things considered, I don't think it surpasses a book for those who tolerate/like reading. BUT, it was still really well done (for what it was), and I'd say it was a totally positive experience, with lots of potential for the future. The story was really interesting (although the pacing was too slow, at times), and the whole art design helped a great deal, it was highly stylised, in a good way.For the developing team: I'd love to see this done with a \"Choose your adventure\" type of book, I think that would be the format where it would shine! Maybe do some research into old Text VideoGames and try to adapt them as well. Who knows? But experimenting is the way to go, and, for the first \"Digital Adaptation\", I think it was pretty good. I'll follow you closely and see what else you can provide.Oh, and also, a little bit more exploration, maybe with Diary Pages or Audio Logs spread throughout the places one can explore to provide more information about the story and the era it's set in.Bottom-line: Not a game, still not quite as content-full as a book, but a nice experience overall, with fitting Music and Art Style. I'm interested to see where it goes! If you think you'll take some enjoyment out of something like this, go ahead and buy it, it's pretty good!",
